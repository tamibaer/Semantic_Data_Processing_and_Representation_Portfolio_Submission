Rousillon. The COUNT's palace. Enter the of Rousillon, and all in black In delivering my son from me, bury a second husband. And in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death anew: but must attend his majesty's command, to whom am now in ward, evermore in subjection. You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you, sir, a father: he that so generally is at all times good must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather than lack it where there is such abundance. What hope is there of his majesty's amendment? He hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and finds no other advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time. This young gentlewoman had a father,--O, that 'had'! how sad a passage 'tis!--whose skill was almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so far, would have made nature immortal, and death should have play for lack of work. Would, for the king's sake, he were living! think it would be the death of the king's disease. How called you the man you speak of, madam? He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon. He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge could be set up against mortality. What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of? fistula, my lord. heard not of it before. would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman the daughter of Gerard de Narbon? His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my overlooking. have those hopes of her good that her education promises; her dispositions she inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there commendations go with pity; they are virtues and traitors too; in her they are the better for their simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness. Your commendations, madam, get from her tears. 'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in. The remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena; go to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect a sorrow than have it. do affect a sorrow indeed, but have it too. Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead, excessive grief the enemy to the living. If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess makes it soon mortal. Madam, desire your holy wishes. How understand we that? Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father In manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few, Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend Under thy own life's key: be cheque'd for silence, But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will, That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down, Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord; 'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord, Advise him. He cannot want the best That shall attend his love. Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram. Exit [To The best wishes that can be forged in your thoughts be servants to you! Be comfortable to my mother, your mistress, and make much of her. Farewell, pretty lady: you must hold the credit of your father. Exeunt and were that all! think not on my father; And these great tears grace his remembrance more Than those shed for him. What was he like? have forgot him: my imagination Carries no favour in't but Bertram's. am undone: there is no living, none, If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one That should love a bright particular star And think to wed it, he is so above me: In his bright radiance and collateral light Must be comforted, not in his sphere. The ambition in my love thus plagues itself: The hind that would be mated by the lion Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though plague, To see him every hour; to sit and draw His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls, In our heart's table; heart too capable Of every line and trick of his sweet favour: But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here? Enter Aside One that goes with him: love him for his sake; And yet know him a notorious liar, Think him a great way fool, solely a coward; Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him, That they take place, when virtue's steely bones Look bleak i' the cold wind: withal, full oft we see Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly. Save you, fair queen! And you, monarch! No. And no. Are you meditating on virginity? Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how may we barricado it against him? Keep him out. But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant, in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some warlike resistance. There is none: man, sitting down before you, will undermine you and blow you up. Bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers up! Is there no military policy, how virgins might blow up men? Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational increase and there was never virgin got till virginity was first lost. That you were made of is metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't! will stand for 't a little, though therefore die a virgin. There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity, is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin: virginity murders itself and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites, much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach. Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose by't: out with 't! within ten year it will make itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the principal itself not much the worse: away with 't! How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking? Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it likes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't while 'tis vendible; answer the time of request. Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out of fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not now. Your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity, your old virginity, is like one of our French withered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry, 'tis a withered pear; it was formerly better; marry, yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it? Not my virginity yet [ ] There shall your master have a thousand loves, mother and a mistress and a friend, phoenix, captain and an enemy, guide, a goddess, and a sovereign, counsellor, a traitress, and a dear; His humble ambition, proud humility, His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet, His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms, That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he-- know not what he shall. God send him well! The court's a learning place, and he is one-- What one, i' faith? That wish well. 'Tis pity-- What's pity? That wishing well had not a body in't, Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born, Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes, Might with effects of them follow our friends, And show what we alone must think, which never Return us thanks. Enter Page Page Monsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you. Exit Little Helen, farewell; if can remember thee, will think of thee at court. Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star. Under Mars, especially think, under Mars. Why under Mars? The wars have so kept you under that you must needs be born under Mars. When he was predominant. When he was retrograde, think, rather. Why think you so? You go so much backward when you fight. That's for advantage. So is running away, when fear proposes the safety; but the composition that your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of a good wing, and like the wear well. am so full of businesses, cannot answer thee acutely. will return perfect courtier; in the which, my instruction shall serve to naturalize thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon thee; else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and thine ignorance makes thee away: farewell. When thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast none, remember thy friends; get thee a good husband, and use him as he uses thee; so, farewell. Exit Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie, Which we ascribe to heaven: the fated sky Gives us free scope, only doth backward pull Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull. What power is it which mounts my love so high, That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye? The mightiest space in fortune nature brings To join like likes and kiss like native things. Impossible be strange attempts to those That weigh their pains in sense and do suppose What hath been cannot be: who ever strove So show her merit, that did miss her love? The king's disease--my project may deceive me, But my intents are fix'd and will not leave me. Exit Paris. The KING's palace. Flourish of cornets. Enter the of France, with letters, and divers Attendants The Florentines and Senoys are by the ears; Have fought with equal fortune and continue braving war. First Lord So 'tis reported, sir. Nay, 'tis most credible; we here received it certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria, With caution that the Florentine will move us For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend Prejudicates the business and would seem To have us make denial. First Lord His love and wisdom, Approved so to your majesty, may plead For amplest credence. He hath arm'd our answer, And Florence is denied before he comes: Yet, for our gentlemen that mean to see The Tuscan service, freely have they leave To stand on either part. Second Lord It well may serve nursery to our gentry, who are sick For breathing and exploit. What's he comes here? Enter and First Lord It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord, Young Bertram. Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face; Frank nature, rather curious than in haste, Hath well composed thee. Thy father's moral parts Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris. My thanks and duty are your majesty's. would had that corporal soundness now, As when thy father and myself in friendship First tried our soldiership! He did look far Into the service of the time and was Discipled of the bravest: he lasted long; But on us both did haggish age steal on And wore us out of act. It much repairs me To talk of your good father. In his youth He had the wit which can well observe To-day in our young lords; but they may jest Till their own scorn return to them unnoted Ere they can hide their levity in honour; So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were, His equal had awaked them, and his honour, Clock to itself, knew the true minute when Exception bid him speak, and at this time His tongue obey'd his hand: who were below him He used as creatures of another place And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks, Making them proud of his humility, In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man Might be a copy to these younger times; Which, follow'd well, would demonstrate them now But goers backward. His good remembrance, sir, Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb; So in approof lives not his epitaph As in your royal speech. Would were with him! He would always say-- Methinks hear him now; his plausive words He scatter'd not in ears, but grafted them, To grow there and to bear,--'Let me not live,'-- This his good melancholy oft began, On the catastrophe and heel of pastime, When it was out,--'Let me not live,' quoth he, 'After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses All but new things disdain; whose judgments are Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies Expire before their fashions.' This he wish'd; after him do after him wish too, Since nor wax nor honey can bring home, quickly were dissolved from my hive, To give some labourers room. Second Lord You are loved, sir: They that least lend it you shall lack you first. fill a place, know't. How long is't, count, Since the physician at your father's died? He was much famed. Some six months since, my lord. If he were living, would try him yet. Lend me an arm; the rest have worn me out With several applications; nature and sickness Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, count; My son's no dearer. Thank your majesty. Exeunt. Flourish Rousillon. The COUNT's palace. Enter Steward, and Clown will now hear; what say you of this gentlewoman? Steward Madam, the care have had to even your content, wish might be found in the calendar of my past endeavours; for then we wound our modesty and make foul the clearness of our deservings, when of ourselves we publish them. What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah: the complaints have heard of you do not all believe: 'tis my slowness that do not; for know you lack not folly to commit them, and have ability enough to make such knaveries yours. Clown 'Tis not unknown to you, madam, am a poor fellow. Well, sir. Clown No, madam, 'tis not so well that am poor, though many of the rich are damned: but, if may have your ladyship's good will to go to the world, Isbel the woman and will do as we may. Wilt thou needs be a beggar? Clown do beg your good will in this case. In what case? Clown In Isbel's case and mine own. Service is no heritage: and think shall never have the blessing of God till have issue o' my body; for they say barnes are blessings. Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry. Clown My poor body, madam, requires it: am driven on by the flesh; and he must needs go that the devil drives. Is this all your worship's reason? Clown Faith, madam, have other holy reasons such as they are. May the world know them? Clown have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and all flesh and blood are; and, indeed, do marry that may repent. Thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness. Clown am out o' friends, madam; and hope to have friends for my wife's sake. Such friends are thine enemies, knave. Clown You're shallow, madam, in great friends; for the knaves come to do that for me which am aweary of. He that ears my land spares my team and gives me leave to in the crop; if be his cuckold, he's my drudge: he that comforts my wife is the cherisher of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my flesh and blood is my friend: ergo, he that kisses my wife is my friend. If men could be contented to be what they are, there were no fear in marriage; for young Charbon the Puritan and old Poysam the Papist, howsome'er their hearts are severed in religion, their heads are both one; they may jowl horns together, like any deer i' the herd. Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouthed and calumnious knave? Clown prophet madam; and speak the truth the next way: For the ballad will repeat, Which men full true shall find; Your marriage comes by destiny, Your cuckoo sings by kind. Get you gone, sir; I'll talk with you more anon. Steward May it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to you: of her am to speak. Sirrah, tell my gentlewoman would speak with her; Helen, mean. Clown Was this fair face the cause, quoth she, Why the Grecians sacked Troy? Fond done, done fond, Was this King Priam's joy? With that she sighed as she stood, With that she sighed as she stood, And gave this sentence then; Among nine bad if one be good, Among nine bad if one be good, There's yet one good in ten. What, one good in ten? you corrupt the song, sirrah. Clown One good woman in ten, madam; which is a purifying o' the song: would God would serve the world so all the year! we'ld find no fault with the tithe-woman, if were the parson. One in ten, quoth a'! An we might have a good woman born but one every blazing star, or at an earthquake, 'twould mend the lottery well: a man may draw his heart out, ere a' pluck one. You'll be gone, sir knave, and do as command you. Clown That man should be at woman's command, and yet no hurt done! Though honesty be no puritan, yet it will do no hurt; it will wear the surplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart. am going, forsooth: the business is for Helen to come hither. Exit Well, now. Steward know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely. Faith, do: her father bequeathed her to me; and she herself, without other advantage, may lawfully make title to as much love as she finds: there is more owing her than is paid; and more shall be paid her than she'll demand. Steward Madam, was very late more near her than think she wished me: alone she was, and did communicate to herself her own words to her own ears; she thought, dare vow for her, they touched not any stranger sense. Her matter was, she loved your son: Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put such difference betwixt their two estates; Love no god, that would not extend his might, only where qualities were level; Dian no queen of virgins, that would suffer her poor knight surprised, without rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward. This she delivered in the most bitter touch of sorrow that e'er heard virgin exclaim in: which held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal; sithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns you something to know it. You have discharged this honestly; keep it to yourself: many likelihoods informed me of this before, which hung so tottering in the balance that could neither believe nor misdoubt. Pray you, leave me: stall this in your bosom; and thank you for your honest care: will speak with you further anon. Exit Steward Enter Even so it was with me when was young: If ever we are nature's, these are ours; this thorn Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong; Our blood to us, this to our blood is born; It is the show and seal of nature's truth, Where love's strong passion is impress'd in youth: By our remembrances of days foregone, Such were our faults, or then we thought them none. Her eye is sick on't: observe her now. What is your pleasure, madam? You know, Helen, am a mother to you. Mine honourable mistress. Nay, a mother: Why not a mother? When said 'a mother,' Methought you saw a serpent: what's in 'mother,' That you start at it? say, am your mother; And put you in the catalogue of those That were enwombed mine: 'tis often seen Adoption strives with nature and choice breeds native slip to us from foreign seeds: You ne'er oppress'd me with a mother's groan, Yet express to you a mother's care: God's mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood To say am thy mother? What's the matter, That this distemper'd messenger of wet, The many-colour'd Iris, rounds thine eye? Why? that you are my daughter? That am not. say, am your mother. Pardon, madam; The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother: am from humble, he from honour'd name; No note upon my parents, his all noble: My master, my dear lord he is; and His servant live, and will his vassal die: He must not be my brother. Nor your mother? You are my mother, madam; would you were,-- So that my lord your son were not my brother,-- Indeed my mother! or were you both our mothers, care no more for than do for heaven, So were not his sister. Can't no other, But, your daughter, he must be my brother? Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law: God shield you mean it not! daughter and mother So strive upon your pulse. What, pale again? My fear hath catch'd your fondness: now see The mystery of your loneliness, and find Your salt tears' head: now to all sense 'tis gross You love my son; invention is ashamed, Against the proclamation of thy passion, To say thou dost not: therefore tell me true; But tell me then, 'tis so; for, look thy cheeks Confess it, th' one to th' other; and thine eyes See it so grossly shown in thy behaviors That in their kind they speak it: only sin And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue, That truth should be suspected. Speak, is't so? If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew; If it be not, forswear't: howe'er, charge thee, As heaven shall work in me for thine avail, Tell me truly. Good madam, pardon me! Do you love my son? Your pardon, noble mistress! Love you my son? Do not you love him, madam? Go not about; my love hath in't a bond, Whereof the world takes note: come, come, disclose The state of your affection; for your passions Have to the full appeach'd. Then, confess, Here on my knee, before high heaven and you, That before you, and next unto high heaven, love your son. My friends were poor, but honest; so's my love: Be not offended; for it hurts not him That he is loved of me: follow him not By any token of presumptuous suit; Nor would have him till do deserve him; Yet never know how that desert should be. know love in vain, strive against hope; Yet in this captious and intenible sieve still pour in the waters of my love And lack not to lose still: thus, Indian-like, Religious in mine error, adore The sun, that looks upon his worshipper, But knows of him no more. My dearest madam, Let not your hate encounter with my love For loving where you do: but if yourself, Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth, Did ever in so true a flame of liking Wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian Was both herself and love: then, give pity To her, whose state is such that cannot choose But lend and give where she is sure to lose; That seeks not to find that her search implies, But riddle-like lives sweetly where she dies! Had you not lately an intent,--speak truly,-- To go to Paris? Madam, had. Wherefore? tell true. will tell truth; by grace itself swear. You know my father left me some prescriptions Of rare and proved effects, such as his reading And manifest experience had collected For general sovereignty; and that he will'd me In heedfull'st reservation to bestow them, As notes whose faculties inclusive were More than they were in note: amongst the rest, There is a remedy, approved, set down, To cure the desperate languishings whereof The king is render'd lost. This was your motive For Paris, was it? speak. My lord your son made me to think of this; Else Paris and the medicine and the king Had from the conversation of my thoughts Haply been absent then. But think you, Helen, If you should tender your supposed aid, He would receive it? he and his physicians Are of a mind; he, that they cannot help him, They, that they cannot help: how shall they credit poor unlearned virgin, when the schools, Embowell'd of their doctrine, have left off The danger to itself? There's something in't, More than my father's skill, which was the greatest Of his profession, that his good receipt Shall for my legacy be sanctified By the luckiest stars in heaven: and, would your honour But give me leave to try success, I'ld venture The well-lost life of mine on his grace's cure By such a day and hour. Dost thou believe't? Ay, madam, knowingly. Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love, Means and attendants and my loving greetings To those of mine in court: I'll stay at home And pray God's blessing into thy attempt: Be gone to-morrow; and be sure of this, What can help thee to thou shalt not miss.

To the court! why, what place make you special, when you put off that with such contempt? But to the court! Clown Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he may easily put it off at court: he that cannot make a leg, put off's cap, kiss his hand and say nothing, has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap; and indeed such a fellow, to say precisely, were not for the court; but for me, have an answer will serve all men. Marry, that's a bountiful answer that fits all questions. Clown It is like a barber's chair that fits all buttocks, the pin-buttock, the quatch-buttock, the brawn buttock, or any buttock. Will your answer serve fit to all questions? Clown As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney, as your French crown for your taffeta punk, as Tib's rush for Tom's forefinger, as a pancake for Shrove Tuesday, a morris for May-day, as the nail to his hole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding queen to a wrangling knave, as the nun's lip to the friar's mouth, nay, as the pudding to his skin. Have you, say, an answer of such fitness for all questions? Clown From below your duke to beneath your constable, it will fit any question. It must be an answer of most monstrous size that must fit all demands. Clown But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned should speak truth of it: here it is, and all that belongs to't. Ask me if am a courtier: it shall do you no harm to learn. To be young again, if we could: will be a fool in question, hoping to be the wiser by your answer. pray you, sir, are you a courtier? Clown Lord, sir! There's a simple putting off. More, more, a hundred of them. Sir, am a poor friend of yours, that loves you. Clown Lord, sir! Thick, thick, spare not me. think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat. Clown Lord, sir! Nay, put me to't, warrant you. You were lately whipped, sir, as think. Clown Lord, sir! spare not me. Do you cry, Lord, sir!' at your whipping, and 'spare not me?' Indeed your Lord, sir!' is very sequent to your whipping: you would answer very well to a whipping, if you were but bound to't. Clown ne'er had worse luck in my life in my Lord, sir!' see things may serve long, but not serve ever. play the noble housewife with the time To entertain't so merrily with a fool. Clown Lord, sir! why, there't serves well again. An end, sir; to your business. Give Helen this, And urge her to a present answer back: Commend me to my kinsmen and my son: This is not much. Clown Not much commendation to them. Not much employment for you: you understand me? Clown Most fruitfully: am there before my legs. Haste you again. Exeunt severally Paris. The KING's palace.

Make choice; and, see, Who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me. Now, Dian, from thy altar do fly, And to imperial Love, that god most high, Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit? First Lord And grant it. Thanks, sir; all the rest is mute. had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace for my life. The honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes, Before speak, too threateningly replies: Love make your fortunes twenty times above Her that so wishes and her humble love! Second Lord No better, if you please. My wish receive, Which great Love grant! and so, take my leave. Do all they deny her? An they were sons of mine, I'd have them whipped; or would send them to the Turk, to make eunuchs of. Be not afraid that your hand should take; I'll never do you wrong for your own sake: Blessing upon your vows! and in your bed Find fairer fortune, if you ever wed! These boys are boys of ice, they'll none have her: sure, they are bastards to the English; the French ne'er got 'em. You are too young, too happy, and too good, To make yourself a son out of my blood. Fourth Lord Fair one, think not so.

My wife, my liege! shall beseech your highness, In such a business give me leave to use The help of mine own eyes. Know'st thou not, Bertram, What she has done for me? Yes, my good lord; But never hope to know why should marry her. Thou know'st she has raised me from my sickly bed. But follows it, my lord, to bring me down Must answer for your raising? know her well: She had her breeding at my father's charge. poor physician's daughter my wife! Disdain Rather corrupt me ever! 'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which can build up. Strange is it that our bloods, Of colour, weight, and heat, pour'd all together, Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off In differences so mighty. If she be All that is virtuous, save what thou dislikest, poor physician's daughter, thou dislikest Of virtue for the name: but do not so: From lowest place when virtuous things proceed, The place is dignified by the doer's deed: Where great additions swell's, and virtue none, It is a dropsied honour. Good alone Is good without a name. Vileness is so: The property by what it is should go, Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair; In these to nature she's immediate heir, And these breed honour: that is honour's scorn, Which challenges itself as honour's born And is not like the sire: honours thrive, When rather from our acts we them derive Than our foregoers: the mere word's a slave Debosh'd on every tomb, on every grave lying trophy, and as oft is dumb Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb Of honour'd bones indeed. What should be said? If thou canst like this creature as a maid, can create the rest: virtue and she Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me. cannot love her, nor will strive to do't. Thou wrong'st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose. That you are well restored, my lord, I'm glad: Let the rest go. My honour's at the stake; which to defeat, must produce my power. Here, take her hand, Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift; That dost in vile misprision shackle up My love and her desert; that canst not dream, We, poising us in her defective scale, Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know, It is in us to plant thine honour where We please to have it grow. Cheque thy contempt: Obey our will, which travails in thy good: Believe not thy disdain, but presently Do thine own fortunes that obedient right Which both thy duty owes and our power claims; Or will throw thee from my care for ever Into the staggers and the careless lapse Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate Loosing upon thee, in the name of justice, Without all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer. Pardon, my gracious lord; for submit My fancy to your eyes: when consider What great creation and what dole of honour Flies where you bid it, find that she, which late Was in my nobler thoughts most base, is now The praised of the king; who, so ennobled, Is as 'twere born so. Take her by the hand, And tell her she is thine: to whom promise counterpoise, if not to thy estate balance more replete. take her hand.

Thou wert best set thy lower part where thy nose stands. By mine honour, if were but two hours younger, I'ld beat thee: methinks, thou art a general offence, and every man should beat thee: think thou wast created for men to breathe themselves upon thee. This is hard and undeserved measure, my lord. Go to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking a kernel out of a pomegranate; you are a vagabond and no true traveller: you are more saucy with lords and honourable personages than the commission of your birth and virtue gives you heraldry.

There's letters from my mother: what the import is, know not yet. Ay, that would be known. To the wars, my boy, to the wars! He wears his honour in a box unseen, That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home, Spending his manly marrow in her arms, Which should sustain the bound and high curvet Of Mars's fiery steed. To other regions France is a stable; we that dwell in't jades; Therefore, to the war! It shall be so: I'll send her to my house, Acquaint my mother with my hate to her, And wherefore am fled; write to the king That which durst not speak; his present gift Shall furnish me to those Italian fields, Where noble fellows strike: war is no strife To the dark house and the detested wife. Will this capriccio hold in thee? art sure? Go with me to my chamber, and advise me. I'll send her straight away: to-morrow I'll to the wars, she to her single sorrow. Why, these balls bound; there's noise in it. 'Tis hard: young man married is a man that's marr'd: Therefore away, and leave her bravely; go: The king has done you wrong: but, hush, 'tis so.

If she be very well, what does she ail, that she's not very well? Clown Truly, she's very well indeed, but for two things. What two things? Clown One, that she's not in heaven, whither God send her quickly! the other that she's in earth, from whence God send her quickly!

You had my prayers to lead them on; and to keep them on, have them still. my knave, how does my old lady? Clown So that you had her wrinkles and her money, would she did as you say. Why, say nothing. Clown Marry, you are the wiser man; for many a man's tongue shakes out his master's undoing: to say nothing, to do nothing, to know nothing, and to have nothing, is to be a great part of your title; which is within a very little of nothing. Away! thou'rt a knave. Clown You should have said, sir, before a knave thou'rt a knave; that's, before me thou'rt a knave: this had been truth, sir. Go to, thou art a witty fool; have found thee. Clown Did you find me in yourself, sir? or were you taught to find me?

Look on his letter, madam; here's my passport. Reads When thou canst get the ring upon my finger which never shall come off, and show me a child begotten of thy body that am father to, then call me husband: but in such a 'then' write a 'never.'

Ah, what sharp stings are in her mildest words! Rinaldo, you did never lack advice so much, As letting her pass so: had spoke with her, could have well diverted her intents, Which thus she hath prevented. Steward Pardon me, madam: If had given you this at over-night, She might have been o'erta'en; and yet she writes, Pursuit would be but vain. What angel shall Bless this unworthy husband? he cannot thrive, Unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath Of greatest justice. Write, write, Rinaldo, To this unworthy husband of his wife; Let every word weigh heavy of her worth That he does weigh too light: my greatest grief. Though little he do feel it, set down sharply. Dispatch the most convenient messenger: When haply he shall hear that she is gone, He will return; and hope may that she, Hearing so much, will speed her foot again, Led hither by pure love: which of them both Is dearest to me. have no skill in sense To make distinction: provide this messenger: My heart is heavy and mine age is weak; Grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak.

Widow have told my neighbour how you have been solicited by a gentleman his companion. know that knave; hang him! one Parolles: a filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the young earl. Beware of them, Diana; their promises, enticements, oaths, tokens, and all these engines of lust, are not the things they go under: many a maid hath been seduced by them; and the misery is, example, that so terrible shows in the wreck of maidenhood, cannot for all that dissuade succession, but that they are limed with the twigs that threaten them. hope need not to advise you further; but hope your own grace will keep you where you are, though there were no further danger known but the modesty which is so lost.

God save you, pilgrim! whither are you bound? To Saint Jaques le Grand. Where do the palmers lodge, do beseech you? Widow At the Saint Francis here beside the port. Is this the way? Widow Ay, marry, is't. march afar Hark you! they come this way. If you will tarry, holy pilgrim, But till the troops come by, will conduct you where you shall be lodged; The rather, for think know your hostess As ample as myself. Is it yourself? Widow If you shall please so, pilgrim. thank you, and will stay upon your leisure. Widow You came, think, from France? did so. Widow Here you shall see a countryman of yours That has done worthy service. His name, pray you. The Count Rousillon: know you such a one? But by the ear, that hears most nobly of him: His face know not. Whatsome'er he is, He's bravely taken here. He stole from France, As 'tis reported, for the king had married him Against his liking: think you it is so? Ay, surely, mere the truth: know his lady. There is a gentleman that serves the count Reports but coarsely of her. What's his name? Monsieur Parolles. believe with him, In argument of praise, or to the worth Of the great count himself, she is too mean To have her name repeated: all her deserving Is a reserved honesty, and that have not heard examined. Alas, poor lady! 'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife Of a detesting lord. Widow warrant, good creature, wheresoe'er she is, Her heart weighs sadly: this young maid might do her shrewd turn, if she pleased. How do you mean? May be the amorous count solicits her In the unlawful purpose. Widow He does indeed; And brokes with all that can in such a suit Corrupt the tender honour of a maid: But she is arm'd for him and keeps her guard In honestest defence. The gods forbid else! Widow So, now they come: Drum and Colours Enter and the whole army That is Antonio, the duke's eldest son; That, Escalus. Which is the Frenchman? He; That with the plume: 'tis a most gallant fellow. would he loved his wife: if he were honester He were much goodlier: is't not a handsome gentleman? like him well. 'Tis pity he is not honest: yond's that same knave That leads him to these places: were his lady, would Poison that vile rascal. Which is he? That jack-an-apes with scarfs: why is he melancholy? Perchance he's hurt i' the battle. Lose our drum! well. He's shrewdly vexed at something: look, he has spied us. Widow Marry, hang you! And your courtesy, for a ring-carrier! Exeunt and army Widow The troop is past. Come, pilgrim, will bring you Where you shall host: of enjoin'd penitents There's four or five, to great Saint Jaques bound, Already at my house. humbly thank you: Please it this matron and this gentle maid To eat with us to-night, the charge and thanking Shall be for me; and, to requite you further, will bestow some precepts of this virgin Worthy the note. We'll take your offer kindly. Exeunt Camp before Florence. Enter and the two French Lords Second Lord Nay, good my lord, put him to't; let him have his way. First Lord If your lordship find him not a hilding, hold me no more in your respect. Second Lord On my life, my lord, a bubble. Do you think am so far deceived in him? Second Lord Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge, without any malice, but to speak of him as my kinsman, he's a most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, the owner of no one good quality worthy your lordship's entertainment. First Lord It were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far in his virtue, which he hath not, he might at some great and trusty business in a main danger fail you. would knew in what particular action to try him. First Lord None better than to let him fetch off his drum, which you hear him so confidently undertake to do. Second Lord with a troop of Florentines, will suddenly surprise him; such will have, whom am sure he knows not from the enemy: we will bind and hoodwink him so, that he shall suppose no other but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries, when we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship present at his examination: if he do not, for the promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of base fear, offer to betray you and deliver all the intelligence in his power against you, and that with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never trust my judgment in any thing. First Lord for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum; he says he has a stratagem for't: when your lordship sees the bottom of his success in't, and to what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be melted, if you give him not John Drum's entertainment, your inclining cannot be removed. Here he comes. Enter Second Lord [Aside to for the love of laughter, hinder not the honour of his design: let him fetch off his drum in any hand. How now, monsieur! this drum sticks sorely in your disposition. First Lord pox on't, let it go; 'tis but a drum. 'But a drum'! is't 'but a drum'? drum so lost! There was excellent command,--to charge in with our horse upon our own wings, and to rend our own soldiers! First Lord That was not to be blamed in the command of the service: it was a disaster of war that Caesar himself could not have prevented, if he had been there to command. Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success: some dishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is not to be recovered. It might have been recovered. It might; but it is not now. It is to be recovered: but that the merit of service is seldom attributed to the true and exact performer, would have that drum or another, or 'hic jacet.' Why, if you have a stomach, to't, monsieur: if you think your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of honour again into his native quarter, be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on; will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit: if you speed well in it, the duke shall both speak of it. and extend to you what further becomes his greatness, even to the utmost syllable of your worthiness. By the hand of a soldier, will undertake it. But you must not now slumber in it. I'll about it this evening: and will presently pen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my certainty, put myself into my mortal preparation; and by midnight look to hear further from me. May be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it? know not what the success will be, my lord; but the attempt vow. know thou'rt valiant; and, to the possibility of thy soldiership, will subscribe for thee. Farewell. love not many words. Exit Second Lord No more than a fish loves water. Is not this a strange fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems to undertake this business, which he knows is not to be done; damns himself to do and dares better be damned than to do't? First Lord You do not know him, my lord, as we do: certain it is that he will steal himself into a man's favour and for a week escape a great deal of discoveries; but when you find him out, you have him ever after. Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of this that so seriously he does address himself unto? Second Lord None in the world; but return with an invention and clap upon you two or three probable lies: but we have almost embossed him; you shall see his fall to-night; for indeed he is not for your lordship's respect. First Lord We'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case him. He was first smoked by the old lord Lafeu: when his disguise and he is parted, tell me what a sprat you shall find him; which you shall see this very night. Second Lord must go look my twigs: he shall be caught. Your brother he shall go along with me. Second Lord As't please your lordship: I'll leave you. Exit Now will lead you to the house, and show you The lass spoke of. First Lord But you say she's honest. That's all the fault: spoke with her but once And found her wondrous cold; but sent to her, By this same coxcomb that we have i' the wind, Tokens and letters which she did re-send; And this is all have done. She's a fair creature: Will you go see her? First Lord With all my heart, my lord. Exeunt Florence. The Widow's house. Enter and Widow If you misdoubt me that am not she, know not how shall assure you further, But shall lose the grounds work upon. Widow Though my estate be fallen, was well born, Nothing acquainted with these businesses; And would not put my reputation now In any staining act. Nor would wish you. First, give me trust, the count he is my husband, And what to your sworn counsel have spoken Is so from word to word; and then you cannot, By the good aid that of you shall borrow, Err in bestowing it. Widow should believe you: For you have show'd me that which well approves You're great in fortune. Take this purse of gold, And let me buy your friendly help thus far, Which will over-pay and pay again When have found it. The count he wooes your daughter, Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty, Resolved to carry her: let her in fine consent, As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it. Now his important blood will nought deny That she'll demand: a ring the county wears, That downward hath succeeded in his house From son to son, some four or five descents Since the first father wore it: this ring he holds In most rich choice; yet in his idle fire, To buy his will, it would not seem too dear, Howe'er repented after. Widow Now see The bottom of your purpose. You see it lawful, then: it is no more, But that your daughter, ere she seems as won, Desires this ring; appoints him an encounter; In fine, delivers me to fill the time, Herself most chastely absent: after this, To marry her, I'll add three thousand crowns To what is passed already. Widow have yielded: Instruct my daughter how she shall persever, That time and place with this deceit so lawful May prove coherent. Every night he comes With musics of all sorts and songs composed To her unworthiness: it nothing steads us To chide him from our eaves; for he persists As if his life lay on't. Why then to-night Let us assay our plot; which, if it speed, Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed And lawful meaning in a lawful act, Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact: But let's about it. Exeunt Without the Florentine camp. Enter Second French Lord, with five or six other Soldiers in ambush Second Lord He can come no other way but by this hedge-corner. When you sally upon him, speak what terrible language you will: though you understand it not yourselves, no matter; for we must not seem to understand him, unless some one among us whom we must produce for an interpreter. First Soldier Good captain, let me be the interpreter. Second Lord Art not acquainted with him? knows he not thy voice? First Soldier No, sir, warrant you. Second Lord But what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to us again? First Soldier E'en such as you speak to me. Second Lord He must think us some band of strangers i' the adversary's entertainment. Now he hath a smack of all neighbouring languages; therefore we must every one be a man of his own fancy, not to know what we speak one to another; so we seem to know, is to know straight our purpose: choughs' language, gabble enough, and good enough. As for you, interpreter, you must seem very politic. But couch, ho! here he comes, to beguile two hours in a sleep, and then to return and swear the lies he forges. Enter Ten o'clock: within these three hours 'twill be time enough to go home. What shall say have done? It must be a very plausive invention that carries it: they begin to smoke me; and disgraces have of late knocked too often at my door. find my tongue is too foolhardy; but my heart hath the fear of Mars before it and of his creatures, not daring the reports of my tongue. Second Lord This is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue was guilty of. What the devil should move me to undertake the recovery of this drum, being not ignorant of the impossibility, and knowing had no such purpose? must give myself some hurts, and say got them in exploit: yet slight ones will not carry it; they will say, 'Came you off with so little?' and great ones dare not give. Wherefore, what's the instance? Tongue, must put you into a butter-woman's mouth and buy myself another of Bajazet's mule, if you prattle me into these perils. Second Lord Is it possible he should know what he is, and be that he is? would the cutting of my garments would serve the turn, or the breaking of my Spanish sword. Second Lord We cannot afford you so. Or the baring of my beard; and to say it was in stratagem. Second Lord 'Twould not do. Or to drown my clothes, and say was stripped. Second Lord Hardly serve. Though swore leaped from the window of the citadel. Second Lord How deep? Thirty fathom. Second Lord Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed. would had any drum of the enemy's: would swear recovered it. Second Lord You shall hear one anon. drum now of the enemy's,-- Alarum within Second Lord Throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo. All Cargo, cargo, cargo, villiando par corbo, cargo. ransom, ransom! do not hide mine eyes. They seize and blindfold him First Soldier Boskos thromuldo boskos. know you are the Muskos' regiment: And shall lose my life for want of language; If there be here German, or Dane, low Dutch, Italian, or French, let him speak to me; I'll Discover that which shall undo the Florentine. First Soldier Boskos vauvado: understand thee, and can speak thy tongue. Kerely bonto, sir, betake thee to thy faith, for seventeen poniards are at thy bosom. First Soldier pray, pray, pray! Manka revania dulche. Second Lord Oscorbidulchos volivorco. First Soldier The general is content to spare thee yet; And, hoodwink'd as thou art, will lead thee on To gather from thee: haply thou mayst inform Something to save thy life. let me live! And all the secrets of our camp I'll show, Their force, their purposes; nay, I'll speak that Which you will wonder at. First Soldier But wilt thou faithfully? If do not, damn me. First Soldier Acordo linta. Come on; thou art granted space. Exit, with guarded. short alarum within Second Lord Go, tell the Count Rousillon, and my brother, We have caught the woodcock, and will keep him muffled Till we do hear from them. Second Soldier Captain, will. Second Lord will betray us all unto ourselves: Inform on that. Second Soldier So will, sir. Second Lord Till then I'll keep him dark and safely lock'd. Exeunt Florence. The Widow's house. Enter and They told me that your name was Fontibell. No, my good lord, Diana. Titled goddess; And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul, In your fine frame hath love no quality? If quick fire of youth light not your mind, You are no maiden, but a monument: When you are dead, you should be such a one As you are now, for you are cold and stem; And now you should be as your mother was When your sweet self was got. She then was honest. So should you be. No: My mother did but duty; such, my lord, As you owe to your wife. No more o' that; prithee, do not strive against my vows: was compell'd to her; but love thee By love's own sweet constraint, and will for ever Do thee all rights of service. Ay, so you serve us Till we serve you; but when you have our roses, You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves And mock us with our bareness. How have sworn! 'Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth, But the plain single vow that is vow'd true. What is not holy, that we swear not by, But take the High'st to witness: then, pray you, tell me, If should swear by God's great attributes, loved you dearly, would you believe my oaths, When did love you ill? This has no holding, To swear by him whom protest to love, That will work against him: therefore your oaths Are words and poor conditions, but unseal'd, At least in my opinion. Change it, change it; Be not so holy-cruel: love is holy; And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts That you do charge men with. Stand no more off, But give thyself unto my sick desires, Who then recover: say thou art mine, and ever My love as it begins shall so persever. see that men make ropes in such a scarre That we'll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring. I'll lend it thee, my dear; but have no power To give it from me. Will you not, my lord? It is an honour 'longing to our house, Bequeathed down from many ancestors; Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world In me to lose. Mine honour's such a ring: My chastity's the jewel of our house, Bequeathed down from many ancestors; Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world In me to lose: thus your own proper wisdom Brings in the champion Honour on my part, Against your vain assault. Here, take my ring: My house, mine honour, yea, my life, be thine, And I'll be bid by thee. When midnight comes, knock at my chamber-window: I'll order take my mother shall not hear. Now will charge you in the band of truth, When you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed, Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me: My reasons are most strong; and you shall know them When back again this ring shall be deliver'd: And on your finger in the night I'll put Another ring, that what in time proceeds May token to the future our past deeds. Adieu, till then; then, fail not. You have won wife of me, though there my hope be done. heaven on earth have won by wooing thee. Exit For which live long to thank both heaven and me! You may so in the end. My mother told me just how he would woo, As if she sat in 's heart; she says all men Have the like oaths: he had sworn to marry me When his wife's dead; therefore I'll lie with him When am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid, Marry that will, live and die a maid: Only in this disguise think't no sin To cozen him that would unjustly win. Exit The Florentine camp. Enter the two French Lords and some two or three Soldiers First Lord You have not given him his mother's letter? Second Lord have delivered it an hour since: there is something in't that stings his nature; for on the reading it he changed almost into another man. First Lord He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off so good a wife and so sweet a lady. Second Lord Especially he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure of the king, who had even tuned his bounty to sing happiness to him. will tell you a thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you. First Lord When you have spoken it, 'tis dead, and am the grave of it. Second Lord He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in Florence, of a most chaste renown; and this night he fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour: he hath given her his monumental ring, and thinks himself made in the unchaste composition. First Lord Now, God delay our rebellion! as we are ourselves, what things are we! Second Lord Merely our own traitors. And as in the common course of all treasons, we still see them reveal themselves, till they attain to their abhorred ends, so he that in this action contrives against his own nobility, in his proper stream o'erflows himself. First Lord Is it not meant damnable in us, to be trumpeters of our unlawful intents? We shall not then have his company to-night? Second Lord Not till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour. First Lord That approaches apace; would gladly have him see his company anatomized, that he might take a measure of his own judgments, wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit. Second Lord We will not meddle with him till he come; for his presence must be the whip of the other. First Lord In the mean time, what hear you of these wars? Second Lord hear there is an overture of peace. First Lord Nay, assure you, a peace concluded. Second Lord What will Count Rousillon do then? will he travel higher, or return again into France? First Lord perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether of his council. Second Lord Let it be forbid, sir; so should be a great deal of his act. First Lord Sir, his wife some two months since fled from his house: her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques le Grand; which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she accomplished; and, there residing the tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her grief; in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and now she sings in heaven. Second Lord How is this justified? First Lord The stronger part of it by her own letters, which makes her story true, even to the point of her death: her death itself, which could not be her office to say is come, was faithfully confirmed by the rector of the place. Second Lord Hath the count all this intelligence? First Lord Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from point, so to the full arming of the verity. Second Lord am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this. First Lord How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses! Second Lord And how mightily some other times we drown our gain in tears! The great dignity that his valour hath here acquired for him shall at home be encountered with a shame as ample. First Lord The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and ill together: our virtues would be proud, if our faults whipped them not; and our crimes would despair, if they were not cherished by our virtues. Enter a Messenger How now! where's your master? Servant He met the duke in the street, sir, of whom he hath taken a solemn leave: his lordship will next morning for France. The duke hath offered him letters of commendations to the king. Second Lord They shall be no more than needful there, if they were more than they can commend. First Lord They cannot be too sweet for the king's tartness. Here's his lordship now. Enter How now, my lord! is't not after midnight? have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses, a month's length a-piece, by an abstract of success: have congied with the duke, done my adieu with his nearest; buried a wife, mourned for her; writ to my lady mother am returning; entertained my convoy; and between these main parcels of dispatch effected many nicer needs; the last was the greatest, but that have not ended yet. Second Lord If the business be of any difficulty, and this morning your departure hence, it requires haste of your lordship. mean, the business is not ended, as fearing to hear of it hereafter. But shall we have this dialogue between the fool and the soldier? Come, bring forth this counterfeit module, he has deceived me, like a double-meaning prophesier. Second Lord Bring him forth: has sat i' the stocks all night, poor gallant knave. No matter: his heels have deserved it, in usurping his spurs so long. How does he carry himself? Second Lord have told your lordship already, the stocks carry him. But to answer you as you would be understood; he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk: he hath confessed himself to Morgan, whom he supposes to be a friar, from the time of his remembrance to this very instant disaster of his setting i' the stocks: and what think you he hath confessed? Nothing of me, has a'? Second Lord His confession is taken, and it shall be read to his face: if your lordship be in't, as believe you are, you must have the patience to hear it. Enter guarded, and First Soldier plague upon him! muffled! he can say nothing of me: hush, hush! First Lord Hoodman comes! Portotartarosa First Soldier He calls for the tortures: what will you say without 'em? will confess what know without constraint: if ye pinch me like a pasty, can say no more. First Soldier Bosko chimurcho. First Lord Boblibindo chicurmurco. First Soldier You are a merciful general. Our general bids you answer to what shall ask you out of a note. And truly, as hope to live. First Soldier [Reads] 'First demand of him how many horse the duke is strong.' What say you to that? Five or six thousand; but very weak and unserviceable: the troops are all scattered, and the commanders very poor rogues, upon my reputation and credit and as hope to live. First Soldier Shall set down your answer so? Do: I'll take the sacrament on't, how and which way you will. All's one to him. What a past-saving slave is this! First Lord You're deceived, my lord: this is Monsieur Parolles, the gallant militarist,--that was his own phrase,--that had the whole theoric of war in the knot of his scarf, and the practise in the chape of his dagger. Second Lord will never trust a man again for keeping his sword clean. nor believe he can have every thing in him by wearing his apparel neatly. First Soldier Well, that's set down. Five or six thousand horse, said,-- will say true,--or thereabouts, set down, for I'll speak truth. First Lord He's very near the truth in this. But con him no thanks for't, in the nature he delivers it. Poor rogues, pray you, say. First Soldier Well, that's set down. humbly thank you, sir: a truth's a truth, the rogues are marvellous poor. First Soldier [Reads] 'Demand of him, of what strength they are a-foot.' What say you to that? By my troth, sir, if were to live this present hour, will tell true. Let me see: Spurio, a hundred and fifty; Sebastian, so many; Corambus, so many; Jaques, so many; Guiltian, Cosmo, Lodowick, and Gratii, two hundred and fifty each; mine own company, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bentii, two hundred and fifty each: so that the muster-file, rotten and sound, upon my life, amounts not to fifteen thousand poll; half of the which dare not shake snow from off their cassocks, lest they shake themselves to pieces. What shall be done to him? First Lord Nothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him my condition, and what credit have with the duke. First Soldier Well, that's set down. Reads 'You shall demand of him, whether one Captain Dumain be i' the camp, a Frenchman; what his reputation is with the duke; what his valour, honesty, and expertness in wars; or whether he thinks it were not possible, with well-weighing sums of gold, to corrupt him to revolt.' What say you to this? what do you know of it? beseech you, let me answer to the particular of the inter'gatories: demand them singly. First Soldier Do you know this Captain Dumain? know him: a' was a botcher's 'prentice in Paris, from whence he was whipped for getting the shrieve's fool with child,--a dumb innocent, that could not say him nay. Nay, by your leave, hold your hands; though know his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls. First Soldier Well, is this captain in the duke of Florence's camp? Upon my knowledge, he is, and lousy. First Lord Nay look not so upon me; we shall hear of your lordship anon. First Soldier What is his reputation with the duke? The duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of mine; and writ to me this other day to turn him out o' the band: think have his letter in my pocket. First Soldier Marry, we'll search. In good sadness, do not know; either it is there, or it is upon a file with the duke's other letters in my tent. First Soldier Here 'tis; here's a paper: shall read it to you? do not know if it be it or no. Our interpreter does it well. First Lord Excellently. First Soldier [Reads] 'Dian, the count's a fool, and full of gold,'-- That is not the duke's letter, sir; that is an advertisement to a proper maid in Florence, one Diana, to take heed of the allurement of one Count Rousillon, a foolish idle boy, but for all that very ruttish: pray you, sir, put it up again. First Soldier Nay, I'll read it first, by your favour. My meaning in't, protest, was very honest in the behalf of the maid; for knew the young count to be a dangerous and lascivious boy, who is a whale to virginity and devours up all the fry it finds. Damnable both-sides rogue! First Soldier [Reads] 'When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it; After he scores, he never pays the score: Half won is match well made; match, and well make it; He ne'er pays after-debts, take it before; And say a soldier, Dian, told thee this, Men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss: For count of this, the count's a fool, know it, Who pays before, but not when he does owe it. Thine, as he vowed to thee in thine ear, He shall be whipped through the army with this rhyme in's forehead. Second Lord This is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold linguist and the armipotent soldier. could endure any thing before but a cat, and now he's a cat to me. First Soldier perceive, sir, by the general's looks, we shall be fain to hang you. My life, sir, in any case: not that am afraid to die; but that, my offences being many, would repent out the remainder of nature: let me live, sir, in a dungeon, i' the stocks, or any where, so may live. First Soldier We'll see what may be done, so you confess freely; therefore, once more to this Captain Dumain: you have answered to his reputation with the duke and to his valour: what is his honesty? He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister: for rapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus: he professes not keeping of oaths; in breaking 'em he is stronger than Hercules: he will lie, sir, with such volubility, that you would think truth were a fool: drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will be swine-drunk; and in his sleep he does little harm, save to his bed-clothes about him; but they know his conditions and lay him in straw. have but little more to say, sir, of his honesty: he has every thing that an honest man should not have; what an honest man should have, he has nothing. First Lord begin to love him for this. For this description of thine honesty? pox upon him for me, he's more and more a cat. First Soldier What say you to his expertness in war? Faith, sir, he has led the drum before the English tragedians; to belie him, will not, and more of his soldiership know not; except, in that country he had the honour to be the officer at a place there called Mile-end, to instruct for the doubling of files: would do the man what honour can, but of this am not certain. First Lord He hath out-villained villany so far, that the rarity redeems him. pox on him, he's a cat still. First Soldier His qualities being at this poor price, need not to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt. Sir, for a quart d'ecu he will sell the fee-simple of his salvation, the inheritance of it; and cut the entail from all remainders, and a perpetual succession for it perpetually. First Soldier What's his brother, the other Captain Dumain? Second Lord Why does be ask him of me? First Soldier What's he? E'en a crow o' the same nest; not altogether so great as the first in goodness, but greater a great deal in evil: he excels his brother for a coward, yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is: in a retreat he outruns any lackey; marry, in coming on he has the cramp. First Soldier If your life be saved, will you undertake to betray the Florentine? Ay, and the captain of his horse, Count Rousillon. First Soldier I'll whisper with the general, and know his pleasure. [Aside] I'll no more drumming; a plague of all drums! Only to seem to deserve well, and to beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy the count, have run into this danger. Yet who would have suspected an ambush where was taken? First Soldier There is no remedy, sir, but you must die: the general says, you that have so traitorously discovered the secrets of your army and made such pestiferous reports of men very nobly held, can serve the world for no honest use; therefore you must die. Come, headsman, off with his head. Lord, sir, let me live, or let me see my death! First Lord That shall you, and take your leave of all your friends. Unblinding him So, look about you: know you any here? Good morrow, noble captain. Second Lord God bless you, Captain Parolles. First Lord God save you, noble captain. Second Lord Captain, what greeting will you to my Lord Lafeu? am for France. First Lord Good captain, will you give me a copy of the sonnet you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count Rousillon? an were not a very coward, I'ld compel it of you: but fare you well.

Enter Widow, and That you may well perceive have not wrong'd you, One of the greatest in the Christian world Shall be my surety; 'fore whose throne 'tis needful, Ere can perfect mine intents, to kneel: Time was, did him a desired office, Dear almost as his life; which gratitude Through flinty Tartar's bosom would peep forth, And answer, thanks: duly am inform'd His grace is at Marseilles; to which place We have convenient convoy. You must know am supposed dead: the army breaking, My husband hies him home; where, heaven aiding, And by the leave of my good lord the king, We'll be before our welcome. Widow Gentle madam, You never had a servant to whose trust Your business was more welcome. Nor you, mistress, Ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labour To recompense your love: doubt not but heaven Hath brought me up to be your daughter's dower, As it hath fated her to be my motive And helper to a husband. But, strange men! That can such sweet use make of what they hate, When saucy trusting of the cozen'd thoughts Defiles the pitchy night: so lust doth play With what it loathes for that which is away. But more of this hereafter. You, Diana, Under my poor instructions yet must suffer Something in my behalf. Let death and honesty Go with your impositions, am yours Upon your will to suffer. Yet, pray you: But with the word the time will bring on summer, When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns, And be as sweet as sharp. We must away; Our wagon is prepared, and time revives us: All's well that ends well; still the fine's the crown; Whate'er the course, the end is the renown. Exeunt Rousillon. The COUNT's palace. Enter and Clown No, no, no, your son was misled with a snipt-taffeta fellow there, whose villanous saffron would have made all the unbaked and doughy youth of a nation in his colour: your daughter-in-law had been alive at this hour, and your son here at home, more advanced by the king than by that red-tailed humble-bee speak of. would had not known him; it was the death of the most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had praise for creating. If she had partaken of my flesh, and cost me the dearest groans of a mother, could not have owed her a more rooted love. 'Twas a good lady, 'twas a good lady: we may pick a thousand salads ere we light on such another herb. Clown Indeed, sir, she was the sweet marjoram of the salad, or rather, the herb of grace. They are not herbs, you knave; they are nose-herbs. Clown am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir; have not much skill in grass. Whether dost thou profess thyself, a knave or a fool? Clown fool, sir, at a woman's service, and a knave at a man's. Your distinction? Clown would cozen the man of his wife and do his service. So you were a knave at his service, indeed. Clown And would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service. will subscribe for thee, thou art both knave and fool. Clown At your service. No, no, no. Clown Why, sir, if cannot serve you, can serve as great a prince as you are. Who's that? a Frenchman? Clown Faith, sir, a' has an English name; but his fisnomy is more hotter in France than there. What prince is that? Clown The black prince, sir; alias, the prince of darkness; alias, the devil. Hold thee, there's my purse: give thee not this to suggest thee from thy master thou talkest of; serve him still. Clown am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a great fire; and the master speak of ever keeps a good fire. But, sure, he is the prince of the world; let his nobility remain in's court. am for the house with the narrow gate, which take to be too little for pomp to enter: some that humble themselves may; but the many will be too chill and tender, and they'll be for the flowery way that leads to the broad gate and the great fire. Go thy ways, begin to be aweary of thee; and tell thee so before, because would not fall out with thee. Go thy ways: let my horses be well looked to, without any tricks. Clown If put any tricks upon 'em, sir, they shall be jades' tricks; which are their own right by the law of nature. Exit shrewd knave and an unhappy. So he is. My lord that's gone made himself much sport out of him: by his authority he remains here, which he thinks is a patent for his sauciness; and, indeed, he has no pace, but runs where he will. like him well; 'tis not amiss. And was about to tell you, since heard of the good lady's death and that my lord your son was upon his return home, moved the king my master to speak in the behalf of my daughter; which, in the minority of them both, his majesty, out of a self-gracious remembrance, did first propose: his highness hath promised me to do it: and, to stop up the displeasure he hath conceived against your son, there is no fitter matter. How does your ladyship like it? With very much content, my lord; and wish it happily effected. His highness comes post from Marseilles, of as able body as when he numbered thirty: he will be here to-morrow, or am deceived by him that in such intelligence hath seldom failed. It rejoices me, that hope shall see him ere die. have letters that my son will be here to-night: shall beseech your lordship to remain with me till they meet together. Madam, was thinking with what manners might safely be admitted. You need but plead your honourable privilege. Lady, of that have made a bold charter; but thank my God it holds yet. Re-enter Clown Clown madam, yonder's my lord your son with a patch of velvet on's face: whether there be a scar under't or no, the velvet knows; but 'tis a goodly patch of velvet: his left cheek is a cheek of two pile and a half, but his right cheek is worn bare. scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a good livery of honour; so belike is that. Clown But it is your carbonadoed face. Let us go see your son, pray you: long to talk with the young noble soldier. Clown Faith there's a dozen of 'em, with delicate fine hats and most courteous feathers, which bow the head and nod at every man. Exeunt Marseilles. street.

In happy time; Enter a Gentleman This man may help me to his majesty's ear, If he would spend his power. God save you, sir. Gentleman And you. Sir, have seen you in the court of France. Gentleman have been sometimes there. do presume, sir, that you are not fallen From the report that goes upon your goodness; An therefore, goaded with most sharp occasions, Which lay nice manners by, put you to The use of your own virtues, for the which shall continue thankful. Gentleman What's your will? That it will please you To give this poor petition to the king, And aid me with that store of power you have To come into his presence. Gentleman The king's not here. Not here, sir! Gentleman Not, indeed: He hence removed last night and with more haste Than is his use. Widow Lord, how we lose our pains! yet, Though time seem so adverse and means unfit. do beseech you, whither is he gone? Gentleman Marry, as take it, to Rousillon; Whither am going. do beseech you, sir, Since you are like to see the king before me, Commend the paper to his gracious hand, Which presume shall render you no blame But rather make you thank your pains for it. will come after you with what good speed Our means will make us means. Gentleman This I'll do for you. And you shall find yourself to be well thank'd, Whate'er falls more. We must to horse again. Go, go, provide. Exeunt Rousillon. Before the COUNT's palace. Enter Clown, and following Good Monsieur Lavache, give my Lord Lafeu this letter: have ere now, sir, been better known to you, when have held familiarity with fresher clothes; but am now, sir, muddied in fortune's mood, and smell somewhat strong of her strong displeasure. Clown Truly, fortune's displeasure is but sluttish, if it smell so strongly as thou speakest of: will henceforth eat no fish of fortune's buttering. Prithee, allow the wind. Nay, you need not to stop your nose, sir; spake but by a metaphor. Clown Indeed, sir, if your metaphor stink, will stop my nose; or against any man's metaphor. Prithee, get thee further. Pray you, sir, deliver me this paper. Clown Foh! prithee, stand away: a paper from fortune's close-stool to give to a nobleman! Look, here he comes himself. Enter Here is a purr of fortune's, sir, or of fortune's cat,--but not a musk-cat,--that has fallen into the unclean fishpond of her displeasure, and, as he says, is muddied withal: pray you, sir, use the carp as you may; for he looks like a poor, decayed, ingenious, foolish, rascally knave. do pity his distress in my similes of comfort and leave him to your lordship. Exit My lord, am a man whom fortune hath cruelly scratched. And what would you have me to do? 'Tis too late to pare her nails now. Wherein have you played the knave with fortune, that she should scratch you, who of herself is a good lady and would not have knaves thrive long under her? There's a quart d'ecu for you: let the justices make you and fortune friends: am for other business. beseech your honour to hear me one single word. You beg a single penny more: come, you shall ha't; save your word. My name, my good lord, is Parolles. You beg more than 'word,' then. Cox my passion! give me your hand. How does your drum? my good lord, you were the first that found me! Was in sooth? and was the first that lost thee. It lies in you, my lord, to bring me in some grace, for you did bring me out. Out upon thee, knave! dost thou put upon me at once both the office of God and the devil? One brings thee in grace and the other brings thee out. Trumpets sound The king's coming; know by his trumpets. Sirrah, inquire further after me; had talk of you last night: though you are a fool and a knave, you shall eat; go to, follow. praise God for you. Exeunt Rousillon. The COUNT's palace. Flourish. Enter the two French Lords, with Attendants We lost a jewel of her; and our esteem Was made much poorer by it: but your son, As mad in folly, lack'd the sense to know Her estimation home. 'Tis past, my liege; And beseech your majesty to make it Natural rebellion, done i' the blaze of youth; When oil and fire, too strong for reason's force, O'erbears it and burns on. My honour'd lady, have forgiven and forgotten all; Though my revenges were high bent upon him, And watch'd the time to shoot. This must say, But first beg my pardon, the young lord Did to his majesty, his mother and his lady Offence of mighty note; but to himself The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife Whose beauty did astonish the survey Of richest eyes, whose words all ears took captive, Whose dear perfection hearts that scorn'd to serve Humbly call'd mistress. Praising what is lost Makes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither; We are reconciled, and the first view shall kill All repetition: let him not ask our pardon; The nature of his great offence is dead, And deeper than oblivion we do bury The incensing relics of it: let him approach, stranger, no offender; and inform him So 'tis our will he should. Gentleman shall, my liege. Exit What says he to your daughter? have you spoke? All that he is hath reference to your highness. Then shall we have a match. have letters sent me That set him high in fame. Enter He looks well on't. am not a day of season, For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail In me at once: but to the brightest beams Distracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth; The time is fair again. My high-repented blames, Dear sovereign, pardon to me. All is whole; Not one word more of the consumed time. Let's take the instant by the forward top; For we are old, and on our quick'st decrees The inaudible and noiseless foot of Time Steals ere we can effect them. You remember The daughter of this lord? Admiringly, my liege, at first stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue Where the impression of mine eye infixing, Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me, Which warp'd the line of every other favour; Scorn'd a fair colour, or express'd it stolen; Extended or contracted all proportions To a most hideous object: thence it came That she whom all men praised and whom myself, Since have lost, have loved, was in mine eye The dust that did offend it. Well excused: That thou didst love her, strikes some scores away From the great compt: but love that comes too late, Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried, To the great sender turns a sour offence, Crying, 'That's good that's gone.' Our rash faults Make trivial price of serious things we have, Not knowing them until we know their grave: Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust, Destroy our friends and after weep their dust Our own love waking cries to see what's done, While shame full late sleeps out the afternoon. Be this sweet Helen's knell, and now forget her. Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin: The main consents are had; and here we'll stay To see our widower's second marriage-day. Which better than the first, dear heaven, bless! Or, ere they meet, in me, nature, cesse! Come on, my son, in whom my house's name Must be digested, give a favour from you To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter, That she may quickly come. gives a ring By my old beard, And every hair that's on't, Helen, that's dead, Was a sweet creature: such a ring as this, The last that e'er took her at court, saw upon her finger. Hers it was not. Now, pray you, let me see it; for mine eye, While was speaking, oft was fasten'd to't. This ring was mine; and, when gave it Helen, bade her, if her fortunes ever stood Necessitied to help, that by this token would relieve her. Had you that craft, to reave her Of what should stead her most? My gracious sovereign, Howe'er it pleases you to take it so, The ring was never hers. Son, on my life, have seen her wear it; and she reckon'd it At her life's rate. am sure saw her wear it. You are deceived, my lord; she never saw it: In Florence was it from a casement thrown me, Wrapp'd in a paper, which contain'd the name Of her that threw it: noble she was, and thought stood engaged: but when had subscribed To mine own fortune and inform'd her fully could not answer in that course of honour As she had made the overture, she ceased In heavy satisfaction and would never Receive the ring again. Plutus himself, That knows the tinct and multiplying medicine, Hath not in nature's mystery more science Than have in this ring: 'twas mine, 'twas Helen's, Whoever gave it you. Then, if you know That you are well acquainted with yourself, Confess 'twas hers, and by what rough enforcement You got it from her: she call'd the saints to surety That she would never put it from her finger, Unless she gave it to yourself in bed, Where you have never come, or sent it us Upon her great disaster. She never saw it. Thou speak'st it falsely, as love mine honour; And makest conjectural fears to come into me Which would fain shut out. If it should prove That thou art so inhuman,--'twill not prove so;-- And yet know not: thou didst hate her deadly, And she is dead; which nothing, but to close Her eyes myself, could win me to believe, More than to see this ring. Take him away. Guards seize My fore-past proofs, howe'er the matter fall, Shall tax my fears of little vanity, Having vainly fear'd too little. Away with him! We'll sift this matter further. If you shall prove This ring was ever hers, you shall as easy Prove that husbanded her bed in Florence, Where yet she never was. Exit, guarded am wrapp'd in dismal thinkings. Enter a Gentleman Gentleman Gracious sovereign, Whether have been to blame or no, know not: Here's a petition from a Florentine, Who hath for four or five removes come short To tender it herself. undertook it, Vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech Of the poor suppliant, who by this know Is here attending: her business looks in her With an importing visage; and she told me, In a sweet verbal brief, it did concern Your highness with herself. [Reads] Upon his many protestations to marry me when his wife was dead, blush to say it, he won me. Now is the Count Rousillon a widower: his vows are forfeited to me, and my honour's paid to him. He stole from Florence, taking no leave, and follow him to his country for justice: grant it me, king! in you it best lies; otherwise a seducer flourishes, and a poor maid is undone. will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll for this: I'll none of him. The heavens have thought well on thee Lafeu, To bring forth this discovery. Seek these suitors: Go speedily and bring again the count. am afeard the life of Helen, lady, Was foully snatch'd. Now, justice on the doers! Re-enter guarded wonder, sir, sith wives are monsters to you, And that you fly them as you swear them lordship, Yet you desire to marry. Enter Widow and What woman's that? am, my lord, a wretched Florentine, Derived from the ancient Capilet: My suit, as do understand, you know, And therefore know how far may be pitied. Widow am her mother, sir, whose age and honour Both suffer under this complaint we bring, And both shall cease, without your remedy. Come hither, count; do you know these women? My lord, neither can nor will deny But that know them: do they charge me further? Why do you look so strange upon your wife? She's none of mine, my lord. If you shall marry, You give away this hand, and that is mine; You give away heaven's vows, and those are mine; You give away myself, which is known mine; For by vow am so embodied yours, That she which marries you must marry me, Either both or none. Your reputation comes too short for my daughter; you are no husband for her. My lord, this is a fond and desperate creature, Whom sometime have laugh'd with: let your highness Lay a more noble thought upon mine honour Than for to think that would sink it here. Sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend Till your deeds gain them: fairer prove your honour Than in my thought it lies. Good my lord, Ask him upon his oath, if he does think He had not my virginity. What say'st thou to her? She's impudent, my lord, And was a common gamester to the camp. He does me wrong, my lord; if were so, He might have bought me at a common price: Do not believe him. behold this ring, Whose high respect and rich validity Did lack a parallel; yet for all that He gave it to a commoner o' the camp, If be one. He blushes, and 'tis it: Of six preceding ancestors, that gem, Conferr'd by testament to the sequent issue, Hath it been owed and worn. This is his wife; That ring's a thousand proofs. Methought you said You saw one here in court could witness it. did, my lord, but loath am to produce So bad an instrument: his name's Parolles. saw the man to-day, if man he be. Find him, and bring him hither. Exit an Attendant What of him? He's quoted for a most perfidious slave, With all the spots o' the world tax'd and debosh'd; Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth. Am or that or this for what he'll utter, That will speak any thing? She hath that ring of yours. think she has: certain it is liked her, And boarded her i' the wanton way of youth: She knew her distance and did angle for me, Madding my eagerness with her restraint, As all impediments in fancy's course Are motives of more fancy; and, in fine, Her infinite cunning, with her modern grace, Subdued me to her rate: she got the ring; And had that which any inferior might At market-price have bought. must be patient: You, that have turn'd off a first so noble wife, May justly diet me. pray you yet; Since you lack virtue, will lose a husband; Send for your ring, will return it home, And give me mine again. have it not. What ring was yours, pray you? Sir, much like The same upon your finger. Know you this ring? this ring was his of late. And this was it gave him, being abed. The story then goes false, you threw it him Out of a casement. have spoke the truth. Enter My lord, do confess the ring was hers. You boggle shrewdly, every feather stars you. Is this the man you speak of? Ay, my lord. Tell me, sirrah, but tell me true, charge you, Not fearing the displeasure of your master, Which on your just proceeding I'll keep off, By him and by this woman here what know you? So please your majesty, my master hath been an honourable gentleman: tricks he hath had in him, which gentlemen have. Come, come, to the purpose: did he love this woman? Faith, sir, he did love her; but how? How, pray you? He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman. How is that? He loved her, sir, and loved her not. As thou art a knave, and no knave. What an equivocal companion is this! am a poor man, and at your majesty's command. He's a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator. Do you know he promised me marriage? Faith, know more than I'll speak. But wilt thou not speak all thou knowest? Yes, so please your majesty. did go between them, as said; but more than that, he loved her: for indeed he was mad for her, and talked of Satan and of Limbo and of Furies and know not what: yet was in that credit with them at that time that knew of their going to bed, and of other motions, as promising her marriage, and things which would derive me ill will to speak of; therefore will not speak what know. Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say they are married: but thou art too fine in thy evidence; therefore stand aside. This ring, you say, was yours? Ay, my good lord. Where did you buy it? or who gave it you? It was not given me, nor did not buy it. Who lent it you? It was not lent me neither. Where did you find it, then? found it not. If it were yours by none of all these ways, How could you give it him? never gave it him. This woman's an easy glove, my lord; she goes off and on at pleasure. This ring was mine; gave it his first wife. It might be yours or hers, for aught know. Take her away; do not like her now; To prison with her: and away with him. Unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring, Thou diest within this hour. I'll never tell you. Take her away. I'll put in bail, my liege. think thee now some common customer. By Jove, if ever knew man, 'twas you. Wherefore hast thou accused him all this while? Because he's guilty, and he is not guilty: He knows am no maid, and he'll swear to't; I'll swear am a maid, and he knows not. Great king, am no strumpet, by my life; am either maid, or else this old man's wife. She does abuse our ears: to prison with her. Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir: Exit Widow The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for, And he shall surety me. But for this lord, Who hath abused me, as he knows himself, Though yet he never harm'd me, here quit him: He knows himself my bed he hath defiled; And at that time he got his wife with child: Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick: So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick: And now behold the meaning. Re-enter Widow, with Is there no exorcist Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes? Is't real that see? No, my good lord; 'Tis but the shadow of a wife you see, The name and not the thing. Both, both. pardon! my good lord, when was like this maid, found you wondrous kind. There is your ring; And, look you, here's your letter; this it says: 'When from my finger you can get this ring And are by me with child,' & c. This is done: Will you be mine, now you are doubly won? If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly, I'll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly. If it appear not plain and prove untrue, Deadly divorce step between me and you! my dear mother, do see you living? Mine eyes smell onions; shall weep anon: To Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher: so, thank thee: wait on me home, I'll make sport with thee: Let thy courtesies alone, they are scurvy ones. Let us from point to point this story know, To make the even truth in pleasure flow. To If thou be'st yet a fresh uncropped flower, Choose thou thy husband, and I'll pay thy dower; For can guess that by thy honest aid Thou keep'st a wife herself, thyself a maid. Of that and all the progress, more or less, Resolvedly more leisure shall express: All yet seems well; and if it end so meet, The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet. Flourish The king's a beggar, now the play is done: All is well ended, if this suit be won, That you express content; which we will pay, With strife to please you, day exceeding day: Ours be your patience then, and yours our parts; Your gentle hands lend us, and take our hearts.

You come most carefully upon your hour. 'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco. For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold, And am sick at heart. Have you had quiet guard?

Say, What, is Horatio there? piece of him. Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night? have seen nothing. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy, And will not let belief take hold of him Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us: Therefore have entreated him along With us to watch the minutes of this night; That if again this apparition come, He may approve our eyes and speak to it. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear. Sit down awhile; And let us once again assail your ears, That are so fortified against our story What we have two nights seen. Well, sit we down, And let us hear Bernardo speak of this. Last night of all, When yond same star that's westward from the pole Had made his course to illume that part of heaven Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself, The bell then beating one,-- Enter Ghost Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again! In the same figure, like the king that's dead. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio. Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio. Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder. It would be spoke to. Question it, Horatio. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night, Together with that fair and warlike form In which the majesty of buried Denmark Did sometimes march? by heaven charge thee, speak! It is offended. See, it stalks away! Stay! speak, speak! charge thee, speak! Exit Ghost 'Tis gone, and will not answer. How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale: Is not this something more than fantasy? What think you on't? Before my God, might not this believe Without the sensible and true avouch Of mine own eyes. Is it not like the king? As thou art to thyself: Such was the very armour he had on When he the ambitious Norway combated; So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle, He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. 'Tis strange. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch. In what particular thought to work know not; But in the gross and scope of my opinion, This bodes some strange eruption to our state. Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows, Why this same strict and most observant watch So nightly toils the subject of the land, And why such daily cast of brazen cannon, And foreign mart for implements of war; Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task Does not divide the Sunday from the week; What might be toward, that this sweaty haste Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day: Who is't that can inform me? That can At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, Whose image even but now appear'd to us, Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride, Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet-- For so this side of our known world esteem'd him-- Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact, Well ratified by law and heraldry, Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror: Against the which, a moiety competent Was gaged by our king; which had return'd To the inheritance of Fortinbras, Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant, And carriage of the article design'd, His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, Of unimproved mettle hot and full, Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes, For food and diet, to some enterprise That hath a stomach in't; which is no other-- As it doth well appear unto our state-- But to recover of us, by strong hand And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands So by his father lost: and this, take it, Is the main motive of our preparations, The source of this our watch and the chief head Of this post-haste and romage in the land. think it be no other but e'en so: Well may it sort that this portentous figure Comes armed through our watch; so like the king That was and is the question of these wars. mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. In the most high and palmy state of Rome, little ere the mightiest Julius fell, The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets: As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood, Disasters in the sun; and the moist star Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse: And even the like precurse of fierce events, As harbingers preceding still the fates And prologue to the omen coming on, Have heaven and earth together demonstrated Unto our climatures and countrymen.-- But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again! Re-enter Ghost I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion! If thou hast any sound, or use of voice, Speak to me: If there be any good thing to be done, That may to thee do ease and grace to me, Speak to me: Cock crows If thou art privy to thy country's fate, Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, speak! Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life Extorted treasure in the womb of earth, For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death, Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus. Shall strike at it with my partisan? Do, if it will not stand. 'Tis here! 'Tis here! 'Tis gone! Exit Ghost We do it wrong, being so majestical, To offer it the show of violence; For it is, as the air, invulnerable, And our vain blows malicious mockery. It was about to speak, when the cock crew. And then it started like a guilty thing Upon a fearful summons. have heard, The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat Awake the god of day; and, at his warning, Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air, The extravagant and erring spirit hies To his confine: and of the truth herein This present object made probation. It faded on the crowing of the cock. Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, The bird of dawning singeth all night long: And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad; The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike, No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, So hallow'd and so gracious is the time. So have heard and do in part believe it. But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill: Break we our watch up; and by my advice, Let us impart what we have seen to-night Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it, As needful in our loves, fitting our duty? Let's do't, pray; and this morning know Where we shall find him most conveniently. Exeunt room of state in the castle. Enter Lords, and Attendants Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death The memory be green, and that it us befitted To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom To be contracted in one brow of woe, Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature That we with wisest sorrow think on him, Together with remembrance of ourselves. Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen, The imperial jointress to this warlike state, Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,-- With an auspicious and a dropping eye, With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage, In equal scale weighing delight and dole,-- Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone With this affair along. For all, our thanks. Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras, Holding a weak supposal of our worth, Or thinking by our late dear brother's death Our state to be disjoint and out of frame, Colleagued with the dream of his advantage, He hath not fail'd to pester us with message, Importing the surrender of those lands Lost by his father, with all bonds of law, To our most valiant brother. So much for him. Now for ourself and for this time of meeting: Thus much the business is: we have here writ To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,-- Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress His further gait herein; in that the levies, The lists and full proportions, are all made Out of his subject: and we here dispatch You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand, For bearers of this greeting to old Norway; Giving to you no further personal power To business with the king, more than the scope Of these delated articles allow. Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty. In that and all things will we show our duty. We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell. Exeunt and And now, Laertes, what's the news with you? You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes? You cannot speak of reason to the Dane, And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes, That shall not be my offer, not thy asking? The head is not more native to the heart, The hand more instrumental to the mouth, Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father. What wouldst thou have, Laertes? My dread lord, Your leave and favour to return to France; From whence though willingly came to Denmark, To show my duty in your coronation, Yet now, must confess, that duty done, My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon. Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius? He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave By laboursome petition, and at last Upon his will seal'd my hard consent: do beseech you, give him leave to go. Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine, And thy best graces spend it at thy will! But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,-- [Aside] little more than kin, and less than kind. How is it that the clouds still hang on you? Not so, my lord; am too much i' the sun. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off, And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark. Do not for ever with thy vailed lids Seek for thy noble father in the dust: Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die, Passing through nature to eternity. Ay, madam, it is common. If it be, Why seems it so particular with thee? Seems, madam! nay it is; know not 'seems.' 'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother, Nor customary suits of solemn black, Nor windy suspiration of forced breath, No, nor the fruitful river in the eye, Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage, Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief, That can denote me truly: these indeed seem, For they are actions that a man might play: But have that within which passeth show; These but the trappings and the suits of woe. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet, To give these mourning duties to your father: But, you must know, your father lost a father; That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound In filial obligation for some term To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever In obstinate condolement is a course Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief; It shows a will most incorrect to heaven, heart unfortified, a mind impatient, An understanding simple and unschool'd: For what we know must be and is as common As any the most vulgar thing to sense, Why should we in our peevish opposition Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven, fault against the dead, a fault to nature, To reason most absurd: whose common theme Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried, From the first corse till he that died to-day, 'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth This unprevailing woe, and think of us As of a father: for let the world take note, You are the most immediate to our throne; And with no less nobility of love Than that which dearest father bears his son, Do impart toward you. For your intent In going back to school in Wittenberg, It is most retrograde to our desire: And we beseech you, bend you to remain Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye, Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet: pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg. shall in all my best obey you, madam. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply: Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come; This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof, No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day, But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell, And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again, Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away. Exeunt all but that this too too solid flesh would melt Thaw and resolve itself into a dew! Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! God! God! How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable, Seem to me all the uses of this world! Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden, That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature Possess it merely. That it should come to this! But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two: So excellent a king; that was, to this, Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother That he might not beteem the winds of heaven Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth! Must remember? why, she would hang on him, As if increase of appetite had grown By what it fed on: and yet, within a month-- Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!-- little month, or ere those shoes were old With which she follow'd my poor father's body, Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she-- God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason, Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle, My father's brother, but no more like my father Than to Hercules: within a month: Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears Had left the flushing in her galled eyes, She married. most wicked speed, to post With such dexterity to incestuous sheets! It is not nor it cannot come to good: But break, my heart; for must hold my tongue. Enter and Hail to your lordship! am glad to see you well: Horatio,--or do forget myself. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever. Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you: And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus? My good lord-- am very glad to see you. Good even, sir. But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg? truant disposition, good my lord. would not hear your enemy say so, Nor shall you do mine ear that violence, To make it truster of your own report Against yourself: know you are no truant. But what is your affair in Elsinore? We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart. My lord, came to see your father's funeral. pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student; think it was to see my mother's wedding. Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables. Would had met my dearest foe in heaven Or ever had seen that day, Horatio! My father!--methinks see my father. Where, my lord? In my mind's eye, Horatio. saw him once; he was a goodly king. He was a man, take him for all in all, shall not look upon his like again. My lord, think saw him yesternight. Saw? who? My lord, the king your father. The king my father! Season your admiration for awhile With an attent ear, till may deliver, Upon the witness of these gentlemen, This marvel to you. For God's love, let me hear. Two nights together had these gentlemen, Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch, In the dead vast and middle of the night, Been thus encounter'd. figure like your father, Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe, Appears before them, and with solemn march Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes, Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled Almost to jelly with the act of fear, Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me In dreadful secrecy impart they did; And with them the third night kept the watch; Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time, Form of the thing, each word made true and good, The apparition comes: knew your father; These hands are not more like. But where was this? My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd. Did you not speak to it? My lord, did; But answer made it none: yet once methought It lifted up its head and did address Itself to motion, like as it would speak; But even then the morning cock crew loud, And at the sound it shrunk in haste away, And vanish'd from our sight. 'Tis very strange. As do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true; And we did think it writ down in our duty To let you know of it. Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me. Hold you the watch to-night? We do, my lord. Arm'd, say you? Arm'd, my lord. From top to toe? My lord, from head to foot. Then saw you not his face? yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up. What, look'd he frowningly? countenance more in sorrow than in anger. Pale or red? Nay, very pale. And fix'd his eyes upon you? Most constantly. would had been there. It would have much amazed you. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long? While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred. Longer, longer. Not when saw't. His beard was grizzled--no? It was, as have seen it in his life, sable silver'd. will watch to-night; Perchance 'twill walk again. warrant it will. If it assume my noble father's person, I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape And bid me hold my peace. pray you all, If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight, Let it be tenable in your silence still; And whatsoever else shall hap to-night, Give it an understanding, but no tongue: will requite your loves. So, fare you well: Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve, I'll visit you. All Our duty to your honour. Your loves, as mine to you: farewell. Exeunt all but My father's spirit in arms! all is not well; doubt some foul play: would the night were come! Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise, Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes. Exit room in Polonius' house. Enter and My necessaries are embark'd: farewell: And, sister, as the winds give benefit And convoy is assistant, do not sleep, But let me hear from you. Do you doubt that? For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour, Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood, violet in the youth of primy nature, Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting, The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more. No more but so? Think it no more; For nature, crescent, does not grow alone In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes, The inward service of the mind and soul Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now, And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch The virtue of his will: but you must fear, His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own; For he himself is subject to his birth: He may not, as unvalued persons do, Carve for himself; for on his choice depends The safety and health of this whole state; And therefore must his choice be circumscribed Unto the voice and yielding of that body Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you, It fits your wisdom so far to believe it As he in his particular act and place May give his saying deed; which is no further Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal. Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain, If with too credent ear you list his songs, Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open To his unmaster'd importunity. Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister, And keep you in the rear of your affection, Out of the shot and danger of desire. The chariest maid is prodigal enough, If she unmask her beauty to the moon: Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes: The canker galls the infants of the spring, Too oft before their buttons be disclosed, And in the morn and liquid dew of youth Contagious blastments are most imminent. Be wary then; best safety lies in fear: Youth to itself rebels, though none else near. shall the effect of this good lesson keep, As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother, Do not, as some ungracious pastors do, Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven; Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine, Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads, And recks not his own rede. fear me not. stay too long: but here my father comes. Enter double blessing is a double grace, Occasion smiles upon a second leave. Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame! The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail, And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee! And these few precepts in thy memory See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue, Nor any unproportioned thought his act. Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar. Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried, Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel; But do not dull thy palm with entertainment Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in, Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee. Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice; Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment. Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy, But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy; For the apparel oft proclaims the man, And they in France of the best rank and station Are of a most select and generous chief in that. Neither a borrower nor a lender be; For loan oft loses both itself and friend, And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry. This above all: to thine ownself be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man. Farewell: my blessing season this in thee! Most humbly do take my leave, my lord. The time invites you; go; your servants tend. Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well What have said to you. 'Tis in my memory lock'd, And you yourself shall keep the key of it. Farewell. Exit What is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you? So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet. Marry, well bethought: 'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late Given private time to you; and you yourself Have of your audience been most free and bounteous: If it be so, as so 'tis put on me, And that in way of caution, must tell you, You do not understand yourself so clearly As it behoves my daughter and your honour. What is between you? give me up the truth. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders Of his affection to me. Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl, Unsifted in such perilous circumstance. Do you believe his tenders, as you call them? do not know, my lord, what should think. Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby; That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay, Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly; Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase, Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool. My lord, he hath importuned me with love In honourable fashion. Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord, With almost all the holy vows of heaven. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. do know, When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter, Giving more light than heat, extinct in both, Even in their promise, as it is a-making, You must not take for fire. From this time Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence; Set your entreatments at a higher rate Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet, Believe so much in him, that he is young And with a larger tether may he walk Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia, Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers, Not of that dye which their investments show, But mere implorators of unholy suits, Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds, The better to beguile. This is for all: would not, in plain terms, from this time forth, Have you so slander any moment leisure, As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet. Look to't, charge you: come your ways. shall obey, my lord. Exeunt The platform. Enter and The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold. It is a nipping and an eager air. What hour now? think it lacks of twelve. No, it is struck. Indeed? heard it not: then it draws near the season Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk. flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within What does this mean, my lord? The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse, Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels; And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down, The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out The triumph of his pledge. Is it a custom? Ay, marry, is't: But to my mind, though am native here And to the manner born, it is a custom More honour'd in the breach than the observance. This heavy-headed revel east and west Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations: They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase Soil our addition; and indeed it takes From our achievements, though perform'd at height, The pith and marrow of our attribute. So, oft it chances in particular men, That for some vicious mole of nature in them, As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty, Since nature cannot choose his origin-- By the o'ergrowth of some complexion, Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason, Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens The form of plausive manners, that these men, Carrying, say, the stamp of one defect, Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,-- Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace, As infinite as man may undergo-- Shall in the general censure take corruption From that particular fault: the dram of eale Doth all the noble substance of a doubt To his own scandal. Look, my lord, it comes! Enter Ghost Angels and ministers of grace defend us! Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd, Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell, Be thy intents wicked or charitable, Thou comest in such a questionable shape That will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet, King, father, royal Dane: answer me! Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death, Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre, Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd, Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws, To cast thee up again. What may this mean, That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon, Making night hideous; and we fools of nature So horridly to shake our disposition With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls? Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do? Ghost beckons It beckons you to go away with it, As if it some impartment did desire To you alone. Look, with what courteous action It waves you to a more removed ground: But do not go with it. No, by no means. It will not speak; then will follow it. Do not, my lord. Why, what should be the fear? do not set my life in a pin's fee; And for my soul, what can it do to that, Being a thing immortal as itself? It waves me forth again: I'll follow it. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord, Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff That beetles o'er his base into the sea, And there assume some other horrible form, Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason And draw you into madness? think of it: The very place puts toys of desperation, Without more motive, into every brain That looks so many fathoms to the sea And hears it roar beneath. It waves me still. Go on; I'll follow thee. You shall not go, my lord. Hold off your hands. Be ruled; you shall not go. My fate cries out, And makes each petty artery in this body As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve. Still am call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen. By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me! say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee. Exeunt Ghost and He waxes desperate with imagination. Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him. Have after. To what issue will this come? Something is rotten in the state of Denmark. Heaven will direct it. Nay, let's follow him. Exeunt Another part of the platform. Enter and Where wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further. Ghost Mark me. will. Ghost My hour is almost come, When to sulphurous and tormenting flames Must render up myself. Alas, poor ghost! Ghost Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing To what shall unfold. Speak; am bound to hear. Ghost So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear. What? Ghost am thy father's spirit, Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night, And for the day confined to fast in fires, Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature Are burnt and purged away. But that am forbid To tell the secrets of my prison-house, could a tale unfold whose lightest word Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood, Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres, Thy knotted and combined locks to part And each particular hair to stand on end, Like quills upon the fretful porpentine: But this eternal blazon must not be To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, list! If thou didst ever thy dear father love-- God! Ghost Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder. Murder! Ghost Murder most foul, as in the best it is; But this most foul, strange and unnatural. Haste me to know't, that with wings as swift As meditation or the thoughts of love, May sweep to my revenge. Ghost find thee apt; And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf, Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear: 'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard, serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark Is by a forged process of my death Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth, The serpent that did sting thy father's life Now wears his crown. my prophetic soul! My uncle! Ghost Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast, With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,-- wicked wit and gifts, that have the power So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen: Hamlet, what a falling-off was there! From me, whose love was of that dignity That it went hand in hand even with the vow made to her in marriage, and to decline Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor To those of mine! But virtue, as it never will be moved, Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven, So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd, Will sate itself in a celestial bed, And prey on garbage. But, soft! methinks scent the morning air; Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard, My custom always of the afternoon, Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole, With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial, And in the porches of my ears did pour The leperous distilment; whose effect Holds such an enmity with blood of man That swift as quicksilver it courses through The natural gates and alleys of the body, And with a sudden vigour doth posset And curd, like eager droppings into milk, The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine; And a most instant tetter bark'd about, Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust, All my smooth body. Thus was sleeping, by a brother's hand Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd: Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin, Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd, No reckoning made, but sent to my account With all my imperfections on my head: horrible! horrible! most horrible! If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not; Let not the royal bed of Denmark be couch for luxury and damned incest. But, howsoever thou pursuest this act, Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge, To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once! The glow-worm shows the matin to be near, And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire: Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me. Exit all you host of heaven! earth! what else? And shall couple hell? fie! Hold, hold, my heart; And you, my sinews, grow not instant old, But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee! Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat In this distracted globe. Remember thee! Yea, from the table of my memory I'll wipe away all trivial fond records, All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past, That youth and observation copied there; And thy commandment all alone shall live Within the book and volume of my brain, Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven! most pernicious woman! villain, villain, smiling, damned villain! My tables,--meet it is set it down, That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain; At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark: Writing So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word; It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me.' have sworn 't. [Within] My lord, my lord,-- [Within] Lord Hamlet,-- [Within] Heaven secure him! So be it! [Within] Hillo, ho, ho, my lord! Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come. Enter and How is't, my noble lord? What news, my lord? wonderful! Good my lord, tell it. No; you'll reveal it. Not my lord, by heaven. Nor my lord. How say you, then; would heart of man once think it? But you'll be secret? Ay, by heaven, my lord. There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark But he's an arrant knave. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave To tell us this. Why, right; you are i' the right; And so, without more circumstance at all, hold it fit that we shake hands and part: You, as your business and desire shall point you; For every man has business and desire, Such as it is; and for mine own poor part, Look you, I'll go pray. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord. I'm sorry they offend you, heartily; Yes, 'faith heartily. There's no offence, my lord. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio, And much offence too. Touching this vision here, It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you: For your desire to know what is between us, O'ermaster 't as you may. And now, good friends, As you are friends, scholars and soldiers, Give me one poor request. What is't, my lord? we will. Never make known what you have seen to-night. My lord, we will not. Nay, but swear't. In faith, My lord, not Nor my lord, in faith. Upon my sword. We have sworn, my lord, already. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed. Ghost [Beneath] Swear. Ah, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there, truepenny? Come on--you hear this fellow in the cellarage-- Consent to swear. Propose the oath, my lord. Never to speak of this that you have seen, Swear by my sword. Ghost [Beneath] Swear. Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground. Come hither, gentlemen, And lay your hands again upon my sword: Never to speak of this that you have heard, Swear by my sword. Ghost [Beneath] Swear. Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast? worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends. day and night, but this is wondrous strange! And therefore as a stranger give it welcome. There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come; Here, as before, never, so help you mercy, How strange or odd soe'er bear myself, As perchance hereafter shall think meet To put an antic disposition on, That you, at such times seeing me, never shall, With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake, Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase, As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,' Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,' Or such ambiguous giving out, to note That you know aught of me: this not to do, So grace and mercy at your most need help you, Swear. Ghost [Beneath] Swear. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! They swear So, gentlemen, With all my love do commend me to you: And what so poor a man as Hamlet is May do, to express his love and friending to you, God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together; And still your fingers on your lips, pray. The time is out of joint: cursed spite, That ever was born to set it right! Nay, come, let's go together. Exeunt room in house. Enter and Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo. will, my lord. You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo, Before you visit him, to make inquire Of his behavior. My lord, did intend it. Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir, Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris; And how, and who, what means, and where they keep, What company, at what expense; and finding By this encompassment and drift of question That they do know my son, come you more nearer Than your particular demands will touch it: Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him; As thus, know his father and his friends, And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo? Ay, very well, my lord. 'And in part him; but' you may say 'not well: But, if't be he mean, he's very wild; Addicted so and so:' and there put on him What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank As may dishonour him; take heed of that; But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips As are companions noted and most known To youth and liberty. As gaming, my lord. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling, Drabbing: you may go so far. My lord, that would dishonour him. 'Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge You must not put another scandal on him, That he is open to incontinency; That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly That they may seem the taints of liberty, The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind, savageness in unreclaimed blood, Of general assault. But, my good lord,-- Wherefore should you do this? Ay, my lord, would know that. Marry, sir, here's my drift; And believe, it is a fetch of wit: You laying these slight sullies on my son, As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you, Your party in converse, him you would sound, Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured He closes with you in this consequence; 'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,' According to the phrase or the addition Of man and country. Very good, my lord. And then, sir, does he this--he does--what was about to say? By the mass, was about to say something: where did leave? At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and 'gentleman.' At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry; He closes thus: know the gentleman; saw him yesterday, or t' other day, Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say, There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse; There falling out at tennis:' or perchance, saw him enter such a house of sale,' Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth. See you now; Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth: And thus do we of wisdom and of reach, With windlasses and with assays of bias, By indirections find directions out: So by my former lecture and advice, Shall you my son. You have me, have you not? My lord, have. God be wi' you; fare you well. Good my lord! Observe his inclination in yourself. shall, my lord. And let him ply his music. Well, my lord. Farewell! Exit Enter How now, Ophelia! what's the matter? my lord, my lord, have been so affrighted! With what, i' the name of God? My lord, as was sewing in my closet, Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced; No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd, Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle; Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other; And with a look so piteous in purport As if he had been loosed out of hell To speak of horrors,--he comes before me. Mad for thy love? My lord, do not know; But truly, do fear it. What said he? He took me by the wrist and held me hard; Then goes he to the length of all his arm; And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow, He falls to such perusal of my face As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so; At last, a little shaking of mine arm And thrice his head thus waving up and down, He raised a sigh so piteous and profound As it did seem to shatter all his bulk And end his being: that done, he lets me go: And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd, He seem'd to find his way without his eyes; For out o' doors he went without their helps, And, to the last, bended their light on me. Come, go with me: will go seek the king. This is the very ecstasy of love, Whose violent property fordoes itself And leads the will to desperate undertakings As oft as any passion under heaven That does afflict our natures. am sorry. What, have you given him any hard words of late? No, my good lord, but, as you did command, did repel his fetters and denied His access to me. That hath made him mad. am sorry that with better heed and judgment had not quoted him: fear'd he did but trifle, And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy! By heaven, it is as proper to our age To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions As it is common for the younger sort To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king: This must be known; which, being kept close, might move More grief to hide than hate to utter love. Exeunt room in the castle. Enter and Attendants Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern! Moreover that we much did long to see you, The need we have to use you did provoke Our hasty sending. Something have you heard Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it, Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man Resembles that it was. What it should be, More than his father's death, that thus hath put him So much from the understanding of himself, cannot dream of: entreat you both, That, being of so young days brought up with him, And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior, That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court Some little time: so by your companies To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather, So much as from occasion you may glean, Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus, That, open'd, lies within our remedy. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you; And sure am two men there are not living To whom he more adheres. If it will please you To show us so much gentry and good will As to expend your time with us awhile, For the supply and profit of our hope, Your visitation shall receive such thanks As fits a king's remembrance. Both your majesties Might, by the sovereign power you have of us, Put your dread pleasures more into command Than to entreaty. But we both obey, And here give up ourselves, in the full bent To lay our service freely at your feet, To be commanded. Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern. Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz: And beseech you instantly to visit My too much changed son. Go, some of you, And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is. Heavens make our presence and our practises Pleasant and helpful to him! Ay, amen! Exeunt and some Attendants Enter The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord, Are joyfully return'd. Thou still hast been the father of good news. Have my lord? assure my good liege, hold my duty, as hold my soul, Both to my God and to my gracious king: And do think, or else this brain of mine Hunts not the trail of policy so sure As it hath used to do, that have found The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy. speak of that; that do long to hear. Give first admittance to the ambassadors; My news shall be the fruit to that great feast. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in. Exit He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found The head and source of all your son's distemper. doubt it is no other but the main; His father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage. Well, we shall sift him. Re-enter with and Welcome, my good friends! Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway? Most fair return of greetings and desires. Upon our first, he sent out to suppress His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack; But, better look'd into, he truly found It was against your highness: whereat grieved, That so his sickness, age and impotence Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys; Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine Makes vow before his uncle never more To give the assay of arms against your majesty. Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy, Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee, And his commission to employ those soldiers, So levied as before, against the Polack: With an entreaty, herein further shown, Giving a paper That it might please you to give quiet pass Through your dominions for this enterprise, On such regards of safety and allowance As therein are set down. It likes us well; And at our more consider'd time well read, Answer, and think upon this business. Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour: Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together: Most welcome home! Exeunt and This business is well ended. My liege, and madam, to expostulate What majesty should be, what duty is, Why day is day, night night, and time is time, Were nothing but to waste night, day and time. Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit, And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes, will be brief: your noble son is mad: Mad call it; for, to define true madness, What is't but to be nothing else but mad? But let that go. More matter, with less art. Madam, swear use no art at all. That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity; And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure; But farewell it, for will use no art. Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains That we find out the cause of this effect, Or rather say, the cause of this defect, For this effect defective comes by cause: Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend. have a daughter--have while she is mine-- Who, in her duty and obedience, mark, Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise. Reads 'To the celestial and my soul's idol, the most beautified Ophelia,'-- That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus: Reads 'In her excellent white bosom, these, & c.' Came this from Hamlet to her? Good madam, stay awhile; will be faithful. Reads 'Doubt thou the stars are fire; Doubt that the sun doth move; Doubt truth to be a liar; But never doubt love. dear Ophelia, am ill at these numbers; have not art to reckon my groans: but that love thee best, most best, believe it. Adieu. 'Thine evermore most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him, This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me, And more above, hath his solicitings, As they fell out by time, by means and place, All given to mine ear. But how hath she Received his love? What do you think of me? As of a man faithful and honourable. would fain prove so. But what might you think, When had seen this hot love on the wing-- As perceived it, must tell you that, Before my daughter told me--what might you, Or my dear majesty your queen here, think, If had play'd the desk or table-book, Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb, Or look'd upon this love with idle sight; What might you think? No, went round to work, And my young mistress thus did bespeak: 'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star; This must not be:' and then precepts gave her, That she should lock herself from his resort, Admit no messengers, receive no tokens. Which done, she took the fruits of my advice; And he, repulsed--a short tale to make-- Fell into a sadness, then into a fast, Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness, Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension, Into the madness wherein now he raves, And all we mourn for. Do you think 'tis this? It may be, very likely. Hath there been such a time--I'd fain know that-- That have positively said 'Tis so,' When it proved otherwise? Not that know. [Pointing to his head and shoulder] Take this from this, if this be otherwise: If circumstances lead me, will find Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed Within the centre. How may we try it further? You know, sometimes he walks four hours together Here in the lobby. So he does indeed. At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him: Be you and behind an arras then; Mark the encounter: if he love her not And be not from his reason fall'n thereon, Let me be no assistant for a state, But keep a farm and carters. We will try it. But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading. Away, do beseech you, both away: I'll board him presently. Exeunt and Attendants Enter reading give me leave: How does my good Lord Hamlet? Well, God-a-mercy. Do you know me, my lord? Excellent well; you are a fishmonger. Not my lord. Then would you were so honest a man. Honest, my lord! Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man picked out of ten thousand. That's very true, my lord. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god kissing carrion,--Have you a daughter? have, my lord. Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a blessing: but not as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to 't. [Aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said was a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: and truly in my youth suffered much extremity for love; very near this. I'll speak to him again. What do you read, my lord? Words, words, words. What is the matter, my lord? Between who? mean, the matter that you read, my lord. Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here that old men have grey beards, that their faces are wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir, though most powerfully and potently believe, yet hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for yourself, sir, should be old as am, if like a crab you could go backward. [Aside] Though this be madness, yet there is method in 't. Will you walk out of the air, my lord? Into my grave. Indeed, that is out o' the air. Aside How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. will leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter.--My honourable lord, will most humbly take my leave of you. You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that will more willingly part withal: except my life, except my life, except my life. Fare you well, my lord. These tedious old fools! Enter and You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is. [To God save you, sir! Exit My honoured lord! My most dear lord! My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both? As the indifferent children of the earth. Happy, in that we are not over-happy; On fortune's cap we are not the very button. Nor the soles of her shoe? Neither, my lord. Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her favours? 'Faith, her privates we. In the secret parts of fortune? most true; she is a strumpet. What's the news? None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest. Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true. Let me question more in particular: what have you, my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune, that she sends you to prison hither? Prison, my lord! Denmark's a prison. Then is the world one. goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst. We think not so, my lord. Why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me it is a prison. Why then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too narrow for your mind. God, could be bounded in a nut shell and count myself a king of infinite space, were it not that have bad dreams. Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream. dream itself is but a shadow. Truly, and hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow's shadow. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to the court? for, by my fay, cannot reason. We'll wait upon you. No such matter: will not sort you with the rest of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest man, am most dreadfully attended. But, in the beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore? To visit you, my lord; no other occasion. Beggar that am, am even poor in thanks; but thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come, deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak. What should we say, my lord? Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to colour: know the good king and queen have sent for you. To what end, my lord? That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct with me, whether you were sent for, or no? [Aside to What say you? [Aside] Nay, then, have an eye of you.--If you love me, hold not off. My lord, we were sent for. will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather. have of late--but wherefore know not--lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how express and admirable! in action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts. Why did you laugh then, when said 'man delights not me'? To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they coming, to offer you service. He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickled o' the sere; and the lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't. What players are they? Even those you were wont to take delight in, the tragedians of the city. How chances it they travel? their residence, both in reputation and profit, was better both ways. think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation. Do they hold the same estimation they did when was in the city? are they so followed? No, indeed, are they not. How comes it? do they grow rusty? Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top of question, and are most tyrannically clapped for't: these are now the fashion, and so berattle the common stages--so they call them--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills and dare scarce come thither. What, are they children? who maintains 'em? how are they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing? will they not say afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common players--as it is most like, if their means are no better--their writers do them wrong, to make them exclaim against their own succession? 'Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid for argument, unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question. Is't possible? there has been much throwing about of brains. Do the boys carry it away? Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too. It is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could find it out. Flourish of trumpets within There are the players. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players, which, tell you, must show fairly outward, should more appear like entertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived. In what, my dear lord? am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is southerly know a hawk from a handsaw. Enter Well be with you, gentlemen! Hark you, Guildenstern; and you too: at each ear a hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling-clouts. Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an old man is twice a child. will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players; mark it. You say right, sir: o' Monday morning; 'twas so indeed. My lord, have news to tell you. My lord, have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in Rome,-- The actors are come hither, my lord. Buz, buz! Upon mine honour,-- Then came each actor on his ass,-- The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical- comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are the only men. Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou! What a treasure had he, my lord? Why, 'One fair daughter and no more, The which he loved passing well.' [Aside] Still on my daughter. Am not i' the right, old Jephthah? If you call me Jephthah, my lord, have a daughter that love passing well. Nay, that follows not. What follows, then, my lord? Why, 'As by lot, God wot,' and then, you know, 'It came to pass, as most like it was,'-- the first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for look, where my abridgement comes. Enter four or five Players You are welcome, masters; welcome, all. am glad to see thee well. Welcome, good friends. my old friend! thy face is valenced since saw thee last: comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young lady and mistress! By'r lady, your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when saw you last, by the altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like apiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at any thing we see: we'll have a speech straight: come, give us a taste of your quality; come, a passionate speech. First Player What speech, my lord? heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the play, remember, pleased not the million; 'twas caviare to the general: but it was--as received it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine--an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning. remember, one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affectation; but called it an honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in it chiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; and thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of Priam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin at this line: let me see, let me see-- 'The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,'-- it is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:-- 'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms, Black as his purpose, did the night resemble When he lay couched in the ominous horse, Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd With heraldry more dismal; head to foot Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons, Baked and impasted with the parching streets, That lend a tyrannous and damned light To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire, And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore, With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus Old grandsire Priam seeks.' So, proceed you. 'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good discretion. First Player 'Anon he finds him Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword, Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls, Repugnant to command: unequal match'd, Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide; But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium, Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword, Which was declining on the milky head Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick: So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood, And like a neutral to his will and matter, Did nothing. But, as we often see, against some storm, silence in the heavens, the rack stand still, The bold winds speechless and the orb below As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause, Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work; And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall On Mars's armour forged for proof eterne With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword Now falls on Priam. Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods, In general synod 'take away her power; Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel, And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven, As low as to the fiends!' This is too long. It shall to the barber's, with your beard. Prithee, say on: he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps: say on: come to Hecuba. First Player 'But who, who had seen the mobled queen--' 'The mobled queen?' That's good; 'mobled queen' is good. First Player 'Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe, About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins, blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up; Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd, 'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounced: But if the gods themselves did see her then When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs, The instant burst of clamour that she made, Unless things mortal move them not at all, Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven, And passion in the gods.' Look, whether he has not turned his colour and has tears in's eyes. Pray you, no more. 'Tis well: I'll have thee speak out the rest soon. Good my lord, will you see the players well bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time: after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live. My lord, will use them according to their desert. God's bodykins, man, much better: use every man after his desert, and who should 'scape whipping? Use them after your own honour and dignity: the less they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty. Take them in. Come, sirs. Follow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow. Exit with all the Players but the First Dost thou hear me, old friend; can you play the Murder of Gonzago? First Player Ay, my lord. We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which would set down and insert in't, could you not? First Player Ay, my lord. Very well. Follow that lord; and look you mock him not. Exit First Player My good friends, I'll leave you till night: you are welcome to Elsinore. Good my lord! Ay, so, God be wi' ye; Exeunt and Now am alone. what a rogue and peasant slave am Is it not monstrous that this player here, But in a fiction, in a dream of passion, Could force his soul so to his own conceit That from her working all his visage wann'd, Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect, broken voice, and his whole function suiting With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing! For Hecuba! What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, That he should weep for her? What would he do, Had he the motive and the cue for passion That have? He would drown the stage with tears And cleave the general ear with horrid speech, Make mad the guilty and appal the free, Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak, Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause, And can say nothing; no, not for a king, Upon whose property and most dear life damn'd defeat was made. Am a coward? Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across? Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face? Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat, As deep as to the lungs? who does me this? Ha! 'Swounds, should take it: for it cannot be But am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall To make oppression bitter, or ere this should have fatted all the region kites With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain! Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain! vengeance! Why, what an ass am This is most brave, That the son of a dear father murder'd, Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell, Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words, And fall a-cursing, like a very drab, scullion! Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! have heard That guilty creatures sitting at a play Have by the very cunning of the scene Been struck so to the soul that presently They have proclaim'd their malefactions; For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players Play something like the murder of my father Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks; I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench, know my course. The spirit that have seen May be the devil: and the devil hath power To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps Out of my weakness and my melancholy, As he is very potent with such spirits, Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds More relative than this: the play 's the thing Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king. Exit room in the castle. Enter and And can you, by no drift of circumstance, Get from him why he puts on this confusion, Grating so harshly all his days of quiet With turbulent and dangerous lunacy? He does confess he feels himself distracted; But from what cause he will by no means speak. Nor do we find him forward to be sounded, But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof, When we would bring him on to some confession Of his true state. Did he receive you well? Most like a gentleman. But with much forcing of his disposition. Niggard of question; but, of our demands, Most free in his reply. Did you assay him? To any pastime? Madam, it so fell out, that certain players We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him; And there did seem in him a kind of joy To hear of it: they are about the court, And, as think, they have already order This night to play before him. 'Tis most true: And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties To hear and see the matter. With all my heart; and it doth much content me To hear him so inclined. Good gentlemen, give him a further edge, And drive his purpose on to these delights. We shall, my lord. Exeunt and Sweet Gertrude, leave us too; For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither, That he, as 'twere by accident, may here Affront Ophelia: Her father and myself, lawful espials, Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen, We may of their encounter frankly judge, And gather by him, as he is behaved, If 't be the affliction of his love or no That thus he suffers for. shall obey you. And for your part, Ophelia, do wish That your good beauties be the happy cause Of Hamlet's wildness: so shall hope your virtues Will bring him to his wonted way again, To both your honours. Madam, wish it may. Exit Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you, We will bestow ourselves. To Read on this book; That show of such an exercise may colour Your loneliness. We are oft to blame in this,-- 'Tis too much proved--that with devotion's visage And pious action we do sugar o'er The devil himself. [Aside] 'tis too true! How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience! The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art, Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it Than is my deed to my most painted word: heavy burthen! hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord. Exeunt and Enter To be, or not to be, that is the question, Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep; No more; and by a sleep to say we end The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep; To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub; For in that sleep of death what dreams may come When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, Must give us pause: there's the respect That makes calamity of so long life; For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, The pangs of despised love, the law's delay, The insolence of office and the spurns That patient merit of the unworthy takes, When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear, To grunt and sweat under a weary life, But that the dread of something after death, The undiscover'd country from whose bourn No traveller returns, puzzles the will And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of? Thus conscience does make cowards of us all; And thus the native hue of resolution Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, And enterprises of great pith and moment With this regard their currents turn awry, And lose the name of action.--Soft you now! The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons Be all my sins remember'd. Good my lord, How does your honour for this many a day? humbly thank you; well, well, well. My lord, have remembrances of yours, That have longed long to re-deliver; pray you, now receive them. No, not never gave you aught. My honour'd lord, you know right well you did; And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed As made the things more rich: their perfume lost, Take these again; for to the noble mind Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind. There, my lord. Ha, ha! are you honest? My lord? Are you fair? What means your lordship? That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty. Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty? Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now the time gives it proof. did love you once. Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so. You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it: loved you not. was the more deceived. Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? am myself indifferent honest; but yet could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me: am very proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at my beck than have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as do crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves, all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your father? At home, my lord. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool no where but in's own house. Farewell. help him, you sweet heavens! If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go, and quickly too. Farewell. heavenly powers, restore him! have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God has given you one face, and you make yourselves another: you jig, you amble, and you lisp, and nick-name God's creatures, and make your wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath made me mad. say, we will have no more marriages: those that are married already, all but one, shall live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a nunnery, go. Exit what a noble mind is here o'erthrown! The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword; The expectancy and rose of the fair state, The glass of fashion and the mould of form, The observed of all observers, quite, quite down! And of ladies most deject and wretched, That suck'd the honey of his music vows, Now see that noble and most sovereign reason, Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh; That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth Blasted with ecstasy: woe is me, To have seen what have seen, see what see! Re-enter and Love! his affections do not that way tend; Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little, Was not like madness. There's something in his soul, O'er which his melancholy sits on brood; And do doubt the hatch and the disclose Will be some danger: which for to prevent, have in quick determination Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England, For the demand of our neglected tribute Haply the seas and countries different With variable objects shall expel This something-settled matter in his heart, Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus From fashion of himself. What think you on't? It shall do well: but yet do believe The origin and commencement of his grief Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia! You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said; We heard it all. My lord, do as you please; But, if you hold it fit, after the play Let his queen mother all alone entreat him To show his grief: let her be round with him; And I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear Of all their conference. If she find him not, To England send him, or confine him where Your wisdom best shall think. It shall be so: Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go. Exeunt hall in the castle. Enter and Players Speak the speech, pray you, as pronounced it to you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it, as many of your players do, had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as may say, the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumbshows and noise: would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant; it out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it. First Player warrant your honour. Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with this special o'erstep not the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. there be players that have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely, that, neither having the accent of Christians nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowed that have thought some of nature's journeymen had made men and not made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably. First Player hope we have reformed that indifferently with us, sir. reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them; for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too; though, in the mean time, some necessary question of the play be then to be considered: that's villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready. Exeunt Players Enter and How now, my lord! will the king hear this piece of work? And the queen too, and that presently. Bid the players make haste. Exit Will you two help to hasten them? We will, my lord. Exeunt and What ho! Horatio! Enter Here, sweet lord, at your service. Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man As e'er my conversation coped withal. my dear lord,-- Nay, do not think flatter; For what advancement may hope from thee That no revenue hast but thy good spirits, To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd? No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp, And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear? Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice And could of men distinguish, her election Hath seal'd thee for herself; for thou hast been As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing, man that fortune's buffets and rewards Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are those Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled, That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger To sound what stop she please. Give me that man That is not passion's slave, and will wear him In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart, As do thee.--Something too much of this.-- There is a play to-night before the king; One scene of it comes near the circumstance Which have told thee of my father's death: prithee, when thou seest that act afoot, Even with the very comment of thy soul Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt Do not itself unkennel in one speech, It is a damned ghost that we have seen, And my imaginations are as foul As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note; For mine eyes will rivet to his face, And after we will both our judgments join In censure of his seeming. Well, my lord: If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing, And 'scape detecting, will pay the theft. They are coming to the play; must be idle: Get you a place. Danish march. flourish. Enter and others How fares our cousin Hamlet? Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: eat the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so. have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words are not mine. No, nor mine now. To My lord, you played once i' the university, you say? That did my lord; and was accounted a good actor. What did you enact? did enact Julius Caesar: was killed i' the Capitol; Brutus killed me. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be the players ready? Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience. Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me. No, good mother, here's metal more attractive. [To ho! do you mark that? Lady, shall lie in your lap? Lying down at OPHELIA's feet No, my lord. mean, my head upon your lap? Ay, my lord. Do you think meant country matters? think nothing, my lord. That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs. What is, my lord? Nothing. You are merry, my lord. Who, Ay, my lord. God, your only jig-maker. What should a man do but be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died within these two hours. Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord. So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have a suit of sables. heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half a year: but, by'r lady, he must build churches, then; or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is 'For, for, the hobby-horse is forgot.' Hautboys play. The dumb-show enters Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing him, and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her neck: lays him down upon a bank of flowers: she, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the King's ears, and exit. The Queen returns; finds the King dead, and makes passionate action. The Poisoner, with some two or three Mutes, comes in again, seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts: she seems loath and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts his love Exeunt What means this, my lord? Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief. Belike this show imports the argument of the play. Enter Prologue We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot keep counsel; they'll tell all. Will he tell us what this show meant? Ay, or any show that you'll show him: be not you ashamed to show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means. You are naught, you are naught: I'll mark the play. Prologue For us, and for our tragedy, Here stooping to your clemency, We beg your hearing patiently. Exit Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring? 'Tis brief, my lord. As woman's love. Enter two Players, King and Queen Player King Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground, And thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen About the world have times twelve thirties been, Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands Unite commutual in most sacred bands. Player Queen So many journeys may the sun and moon Make us again count o'er ere love be done! But, woe is me, you are so sick of late, So far from cheer and from your former state, That distrust you. Yet, though distrust, Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must: For women's fear and love holds quantity; In neither aught, or in extremity. Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know; And as my love is sized, my fear is so: Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear; Where little fears grow great, great love grows there. Player King 'Faith, must leave thee, love, and shortly too; My operant powers their functions leave to do: And thou shalt live in this fair world behind, Honour'd, beloved; and haply one as kind For husband shalt thou-- Player Queen confound the rest! Such love must needs be treason in my breast: In second husband let me be accurst! None wed the second but who kill'd the first. [Aside] Wormwood, wormwood. Player Queen The instances that second marriage move Are base respects of thrift, but none of love: second time kill my husband dead, When second husband kisses me in bed. Player King do believe you think what now you speak; But what we do determine oft we break. Purpose is but the slave to memory, Of violent birth, but poor validity; Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree; But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be. Most necessary 'tis that we forget To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt: What to ourselves in passion we propose, The passion ending, doth the purpose lose. The violence of either grief or joy Their own enactures with themselves destroy: Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament; Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident. This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange That even our loves should with our fortunes change; For 'tis a question left us yet to prove, Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love. The great man down, you mark his favourite flies; The poor advanced makes friends of enemies. And hitherto doth love on fortune tend; For who not needs shall never lack a friend, And who in want a hollow friend doth try, Directly seasons him his enemy. But, orderly to end where begun, Our wills and fates do so contrary run That our devices still are overthrown; Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own: So think thou wilt no second husband wed; But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead. Player Queen Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light! Sport and repose lock from me day and night! To desperation turn my trust and hope! An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope! Each opposite that blanks the face of joy Meet what would have well and it destroy! Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife, If, once a widow, ever be wife! If she should break it now! Player King 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile; My spirits grow dull, and fain would beguile The tedious day with sleep. Sleeps Player Queen Sleep rock thy brain, And never come mischance between us twain! Exit Madam, how like you this play? The lady protests too much, methinks. but she'll keep her word. Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in 't? No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i' the world. What do you call the play? The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago is the duke's name; his wife, Baptista: you shall see anon; 'tis a knavish piece of work: but what o' that? your majesty and we that have free souls, it touches us not: let the galled jade wince, our withers are unwrung. Enter This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king. You are as good as a chorus, my lord. could interpret between you and your love, if could see the puppets dallying. You are keen, my lord, you are keen. It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge. Still better, and worse. So you must take your husbands. Begin, murderer; pox, leave thy damnable faces, and begin. Come: 'the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.' Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing; Confederate season, else no creature seeing; Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected, With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected, Thy natural magic and dire property, On wholesome life usurp immediately. Pours the poison into the sleeper's ears He poisons him i' the garden for's estate. His name's Gonzago: the story is extant, and writ in choice Italian: you shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of Gonzago's wife. The king rises. What, frighted with false fire! How fares my lord? Give o'er the play. Give me some light: away! All Lights, lights, lights! Exeunt all but and Why, let the stricken deer go weep, The hart ungalled play; For some must watch, while some must sleep: So runs the world away. Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers-- if the rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me--with two Provincial roses on my razed shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir? Half a share. whole one, For thou dost know, Damon dear, This realm dismantled was Of Jove himself; and now reigns here very, very--pajock. You might have rhymed. good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand pound. Didst perceive? Very well, my lord. Upon the talk of the poisoning? did very well note him. Ah, ha! Come, some music! come, the recorders! For if the king like not the comedy, Why then, belike, he likes it not, perdy. Come, some music! Re-enter and Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you. Sir, a whole history. The king, sir,-- Ay, sir, what of him? Is in his retirement marvellous distempered. With drink, sir? No, my lord, rather with choler. Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to his doctor; for, for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far more choler. Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame and start not so wildly from my affair. am tame, sir: pronounce. The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of spirit, hath sent me to you. You are welcome. Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed. If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, will do your mother's commandment: if not, your pardon and my return shall be the end of my business. Sir, cannot. What, my lord? Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased: but, sir, such answer as can make, you shall command; or, rather, as you say, my mother: therefore no more, but to the matter: my mother, you say,-- Then thus she says; your behavior hath struck her into amazement and admiration. wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother! But is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration? Impart. She desires to speak with you in her closet, ere you go to bed. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any further trade with us? My lord, you once did love me. So do still, by these pickers and stealers. Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you do, surely, bar the door upon your own liberty, if you deny your griefs to your friend. Sir, lack advancement. How can that be, when you have the voice of the king himself for your succession in Denmark? Ay, but sir, 'While the grass grows,'--the proverb is something musty. Re-enter Players with recorders the recorders! let me see one. To withdraw with you:--why do you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive me into a toil? my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly. do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe? My lord, cannot. pray you. Believe me, cannot. do beseech you. know no touch of it, my lord. 'Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with your fingers and thumb, give it breath with your mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops. But these cannot command to any utterance of harmony; have not the skill. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass: and there is much music, excellent voice, in this little organ; yet cannot you make it speak. 'Sblood, do you think am easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me, yet you cannot play upon me. Enter God bless you, sir! My lord, the queen would speak with you, and presently. Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel? By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed. Methinks it is like a weasel. It is backed like a weasel. Or like a whale? Very like a whale. Then will come to my mother by and by. They fool me to the top of my bent. will come by and by. will say so. By and by is easily said. Exit Leave me, friends. Exeunt all but Tis now the very witching time of night, When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out Contagion to this world: now could drink hot blood, And do such bitter business as the day Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother. heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom: Let me be cruel, not unnatural: will speak daggers to her, but use none; My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites; How in my words soever she be shent, To give them seals never, my soul, consent! Exit room in the castle. Enter and like him not, nor stands it safe with us To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you; your commission will forthwith dispatch, And he to England shall along with you: The terms of our estate may not endure Hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow Out of his lunacies. We will ourselves provide: Most holy and religious fear it is To keep those many many bodies safe That live and feed upon your majesty. The single and peculiar life is bound, With all the strength and armour of the mind, To keep itself from noyance; but much more That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest The lives of many. The cease of majesty Dies not alone; but, like a gulf, doth draw What's near it with it: it is a massy wheel, Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount, To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things Are mortised and adjoin'd; which, when it falls, Each small annexment, petty consequence, Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone Did the king sigh, but with a general groan. Arm you, pray you, to this speedy voyage; For we will fetters put upon this fear, Which now goes too free-footed. We will haste us. Exeunt and Enter My lord, he's going to his mother's closet: Behind the arras I'll convey myself, To hear the process; and warrant she'll tax him home: And, as you said, and wisely was it said, 'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother, Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege: I'll call upon you ere you go to bed, And tell you what know. Thanks, dear my lord. Exit my offence is rank it smells to heaven; It hath the primal eldest curse upon't, brother's murder. Pray can not, Though inclination be as sharp as will: My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent; And, like a man to double business bound, stand in pause where shall first begin, And both neglect. What if this cursed hand Were thicker than itself with brother's blood, Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy But to confront the visage of offence? And what's in prayer but this two-fold force, To be forestalled ere we come to fall, Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up; My fault is past. But, what form of prayer Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder'? That cannot be; since am still possess'd Of those effects for which did the murder, My crown, mine own ambition and my queen. May one be pardon'd and retain the offence? In the corrupted currents of this world Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice, And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above; There is no shuffling, there the action lies In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd, Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults, To give in evidence. What then? what rests? Try what repentance can: what can it not? Yet what can it when one can not repent? wretched state! bosom black as death! limed soul, that, struggling to be free, Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay! Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of steel, Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe! All may be well. Retires and kneels Enter Now might do it pat, now he is praying; And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven; And so am revenged. That would be scann'd: villain kills my father; and for that, his sole son, do this same villain send To heaven. this is hire and salary, not revenge. He took my father grossly, full of bread; With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May; And how his audit stands who knows save heaven? But in our circumstance and course of thought, 'Tis heavy with him: and am then revenged, To take him in the purging of his soul, When he is fit and season'd for his passage? No! Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent: When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage, Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed; At gaming, swearing, or about some act That has no relish of salvation in't; Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven, And that his soul may be as damn'd and black As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays: This physic but prolongs thy sickly days. Exit [Rising] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below: Words without thoughts never to heaven go. Exit The Queen's closet. Enter and He will come straight. Look you lay home to him: Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with, And that your grace hath screen'd and stood between Much heat and him. I'll sconce me even here. Pray you, be round with him. [Within] Mother, mother, mother! I'll warrant you, Fear me not: withdraw, hear him coming. hides behind the arras Enter Now, mother, what's the matter? Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended. Mother, you have my father much offended. Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue. Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue. Why, how now, Hamlet! What's the matter now? Have you forgot me? No, by the rood, not so: You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife; And--would it were not so!--you are my mother. Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak. Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge; You go not till set you up a glass Where you may see the inmost part of you. What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me? Help, help, ho! [Behind] What, ho! help, help, help! [Drawing] How now! a rat? Dead, for a ducat, dead! Makes a pass through the arras [Behind] am slain! Falls and dies me, what hast thou done? Nay, know not: Is it the king? what a rash and bloody deed is this! bloody deed! almost as bad, good mother, As kill a king, and marry with his brother. As kill a king! Ay, lady, 'twas my word. Lifts up the array and discovers Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell! took thee for thy better: take thy fortune; Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger. Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down, And let me wring your heart; for so shall, If it be made of penetrable stuff, If damned custom have not brass'd it so That it is proof and bulwark against sense. What have done, that thou darest wag thy tongue In noise so rude against me? Such an act That blurs the grace and blush of modesty, Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose From the fair forehead of an innocent love And sets a blister there, makes marriage-vows As false as dicers' oaths: such a deed As from the body of contraction plucks The very soul, and sweet religion makes rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow: Yea, this solidity and compound mass, With tristful visage, as against the doom, Is thought-sick at the act. Ay me, what act, That roars so loud, and thunders in the index? Look here, upon this picture, and on this, The counterfeit presentment of two brothers. See, what a grace was seated on this brow; Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself; An eye like Mars, to threaten and command; station like the herald Mercury New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill; combination and a form indeed, Where every god did seem to set his seal, To give the world assurance of a man: This was your husband. Look you now, what follows: Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear, Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes? Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed, And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes? You cannot call it love; for at your age The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble, And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have, Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err, Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd But it reserved some quantity of choice, To serve in such a difference. What devil was't That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind? Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight, Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all, Or but a sickly part of one true sense Could not so mope. shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell, If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones, To flaming youth let virtue be as wax, And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame When the compulsive ardour gives the charge, Since frost itself as actively doth burn And reason panders will. Hamlet, speak no more: Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul; And there see such black and grained spots As will not leave their tinct. Nay, but to live In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed, Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love Over the nasty sty,-- speak to me no more; These words, like daggers, enter in mine ears; No more, sweet Hamlet! murderer and a villain; slave that is not twentieth part the tithe Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings; cutpurse of the empire and the rule, That from a shelf the precious diadem stole, And put it in his pocket! No more! king of shreds and patches,-- Enter Ghost Save me, and hover o'er me with your wings, You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure? Alas, he's mad! Do you not come your tardy son to chide, That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by The important acting of your dread command? say! Ghost Do not forget: this visitation Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose. But, look, amazement on thy mother sits: step between her and her fighting soul: Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works: Speak to her, Hamlet. How is it with you, lady? Alas, how is't with you, That you do bend your eye on vacancy And with the incorporal air do hold discourse? Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep; And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm, Your bedded hair, like life in excrements, Starts up, and stands on end. gentle son, Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look? On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares! His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones, Would make them capable. Do not look upon me; Lest with this piteous action you convert My stern effects: then what have to do Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood. To whom do you speak this? Do you see nothing there? Nothing at all; yet all that is see. Nor did you nothing hear? No, nothing but ourselves. Why, look you there! look, how it steals away! My father, in his habit as he lived! Look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal! Exit Ghost This the very coinage of your brain: This bodiless creation ecstasy Is very cunning in. Ecstasy! My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time, And makes as healthful music: it is not madness That have utter'd: bring me to the test, And the matter will re-word; which madness Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace, Lay not that mattering unction to your soul, That not your trespass, but my madness speaks: It will but skin and film the ulcerous place, Whilst rank corruption, mining all within, Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven; Repent what's past; avoid what is to come; And do not spread the compost on the weeds, To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue; For in the fatness of these pursy times Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg, Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good. Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain. throw away the worser part of it, And live the purer with the other half. Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed; Assume a virtue, if you have it not. That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat, Of habits devil, is angel yet in this, That to the use of actions fair and good He likewise gives a frock or livery, That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night, And that shall lend a kind of easiness To the next abstinence: the next more easy; For use almost can change the stamp of nature, And either [ ] the devil, or throw him out With wondrous potency. Once more, good night: And when you are desirous to be bless'd, I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord, Pointing to do repent: but heaven hath pleased it so, To punish me with this and this with me, That must be their scourge and minister. will bestow him, and will answer well The death gave him. So, again, good night. must be cruel, only to be kind: Thus bad begins and worse remains behind. One word more, good lady. What shall do? Not this, by no means, that bid you do: Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed; Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse; And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses, Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers, Make you to ravel all this matter out, That essentially am not in madness, But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know; For who, that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise, Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib, Such dear concernings hide? who would do so? No, in despite of sense and secrecy, Unpeg the basket on the house's top. Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape, To try conclusions, in the basket creep, And break your own neck down. Be thou assured, if words be made of breath, And breath of life, have no life to breathe What thou hast said to me. must to England; you know that? Alack, had forgot: 'tis so concluded on. There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows, Whom will trust as will adders fang'd, They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way, And marshal me to knavery. Let it work; For 'tis the sport to have the engineer Hoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hard But will delve one yard below their mines, And blow them at the moon: 'tis most sweet, When in one line two crafts directly meet. This man shall set me packing: I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room. Mother, good night. Indeed this counsellor Is now most still, most secret and most grave, Who was in life a foolish prating knave. Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you. Good night, mother. Exeunt severally; dragging in room in the castle. Enter and There's matter in these sighs, these profound heaves: You must translate: 'tis fit we understand them. Where is your son? Bestow this place on us a little while. Exeunt and Ah, my good lord, what have seen to-night! What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet? Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit, Behind the arras hearing something stir, Whips out his rapier, cries, rat, a rat!' And, in this brainish apprehension, kills The unseen good old man. heavy deed! It had been so with us, had we been there: His liberty is full of threats to all; To you yourself, to us, to every one. Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd? It will be laid to us, whose providence Should have kept short, restrain'd and out of haunt, This mad young man: but so much was our love, We would not understand what was most fit; But, like the owner of a foul disease, To keep it from divulging, let it feed Even on the pith of Life. Where is he gone? To draw apart the body he hath kill'd: O'er whom his very madness, like some ore Among a mineral of metals base, Shows itself pure; he weeps for what is done. Gertrude, come away! The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch, But we will ship him hence: and this vile deed We must, with all our majesty and skill, Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern! Re-enter and Friends both, go join you with some further aid: Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain, And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him: Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body Into the chapel. pray you, haste in this. Exeunt and Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends; And let them know, both what we mean to do, And what's untimely done. come away! My soul is full of discord and dismay. Exeunt Another room in the castle. Enter Safely stowed. [Within] Hamlet! Lord Hamlet! What noise? who calls on Hamlet? here they come. Enter and What have you done, my lord, with the dead body? Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin. Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence And bear it to the chapel. Do not believe it. Believe what? That can keep your counsel and not mine own. Besides, to be demanded of a sponge! what replication should be made by the son of a king? Take you me for a sponge, my lord? Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance, his rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the king best service in the end: he keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to be last swallowed: when he needs what you have gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you shall be dry again. understand you not, my lord. am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear. My lord, you must tell us where the body is, and go with us to the king. The body is with the king, but the king is not with the body. The king is a thing-- thing, my lord! Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after. Exeunt Another room in the castle. Enter attended have sent to seek him, and to find the body. How dangerous is it that this man goes loose! Yet must not we put the strong law on him: He's loved of the distracted multitude, Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes; And where tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd, But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even, This sudden sending him away must seem Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown By desperate appliance are relieved, Or not at all. Enter How now! what hath befall'n? Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord, We cannot get from him. But where is he? Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure. Bring him before us. Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord. Enter and Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius? At supper. At supper! where? Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is your only emperor for diet: we fat all creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for maggots: your fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service, two dishes, but to one table: that's the end. Alas, alas! man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm. What dost you mean by this? Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts of a beggar. Where is Polonius? In heaven; send hither to see: if your messenger find him not there, seek him i' the other place yourself. But indeed, if you find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go up the stairs into the lobby. Go seek him there. To some Attendants He will stay till ye come. Exeunt Attendants Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,-- Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve For that which thou hast done,--must send thee hence With fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself; The bark is ready, and the wind at help, The associates tend, and every thing is bent For England. For England! Ay, Hamlet. Good. So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes. see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for England! Farewell, dear mother. Thy loving father, Hamlet. My mother: father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England! Exit Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard; Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night: Away! for every thing is seal'd and done That else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste. Exeunt and And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught-- As my great power thereof may give thee sense, Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red After the Danish sword, and thy free awe Pays homage to us--thou mayst not coldly set Our sovereign process; which imports at full, By letters congruing to that effect, The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England; For like the hectic in my blood he rages, And thou must cure me: till know 'tis done, Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun. Exit plain in Denmark. Enter a Captain, and Soldiers, marching Go, captain, from me greet the Danish king; Tell him that, by his licence, Fortinbras Craves the conveyance of a promised march Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous. If that his majesty would aught with us, We shall express our duty in his eye; And let him know so. Captain will do't, my lord. Go softly on. Exeunt and Soldiers Enter and others Good sir, whose powers are these? Captain They are of Norway, sir. How purposed, sir, pray you? Captain Against some part of Poland. Who commands them, sir? Captain The nephews to old Norway, Fortinbras. Goes it against the main of Poland, sir, Or for some frontier? Captain Truly to speak, and with no addition, We go to gain a little patch of ground That hath in it no profit but the name. To pay five ducats, five, would not farm it; Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole ranker rate, should it be sold in fee. Why, then the Polack never will defend it. Captain Yes, it is already garrison'd. Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats Will not debate the question of this straw: This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace, That inward breaks, and shows no cause without Why the man dies. humbly thank you, sir. Captain God be wi' you, sir. Exit Wilt please you go, my lord? I'll be with you straight go a little before. Exeunt all except How all occasions do inform against me, And spur my dull revenge! What is a man, If his chief good and market of his time Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more. Sure, he that made us with such large discourse, Looking before and after, gave us not That capability and god-like reason To fust in us unused. Now, whether it be Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple Of thinking too precisely on the event, thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom And ever three parts coward, do not know Why yet live to say 'This thing's to do;' Sith have cause and will and strength and means To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me: Witness this army of such mass and charge Led by a delicate and tender prince, Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd Makes mouths at the invisible event, Exposing what is mortal and unsure To all that fortune, death and danger dare, Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great Is not to stir without great argument, But greatly to find quarrel in a straw When honour's at the stake. How stand then, That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd, Excitements of my reason and my blood, And let all sleep? while, to my shame, see The imminent death of twenty thousand men, That, for a fantasy and trick of fame, Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause, Which is not tomb enough and continent To hide the slain? from this time forth, My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth! Exit Elsinore. room in the castle. Enter and a Gentleman will not speak with her. Gentleman She is importunate, indeed distract: Her mood will needs be pitied. What would she have? Gentleman She speaks much of her father; says she hears There's tricks i' the world; and hems, and beats her heart; Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt, That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing, Yet the unshaped use of it doth move The hearers to collection; they aim at it, And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts; Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures yield them, Indeed would make one think there might be thought, Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily. 'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds. Let her come in. Exit To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is, Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss: So full of artless jealousy is guilt, It spills itself in fearing to be spilt. Re-enter with Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark? How now, Ophelia! [Sings] How should your true love know From another one? By his cockle hat and staff, And his sandal shoon. Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song? Say you? nay, pray you, mark. Sings He is dead and gone, lady, He is dead and gone; At his head a grass-green turf, At his heels a stone. Nay, but, Ophelia,-- Pray you, mark. Sings White his shroud as the mountain snow,-- Enter Alas, look here, my lord. [Sings] Larded with sweet flowers Which bewept to the grave did go With true-love showers. How do you, pretty lady? Well, God 'ild you! They say the owl was a baker's daughter. Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at your table! Conceit upon her father. Pray you, let's have no words of this; but when they ask you what it means, say you this: Sings To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day, All in the morning betime, And a maid at your window, To be your Valentine. Then up he rose, and donn'd his clothes, And dupp'd the chamber-door; Let in the maid, that out a maid Never departed more. Pretty Ophelia! Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't: Sings By Gis and by Saint Charity, Alack, and fie for shame! Young men will do't, if they come to't; By cock, they are to blame. Quoth she, before you tumbled me, You promised me to wed. So would ha' done, by yonder sun, An thou hadst not come to my bed. How long hath she been thus? hope all will be well. We must be patient: but cannot choose but weep, to think they should lay him i' the cold ground. My brother shall know of it: and so thank you for your good counsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies; good night, good night. Exit Follow her close; give her good watch, pray you. Exit this is the poison of deep grief; it springs All from her father's death. Gertrude, Gertrude, When sorrows come, they come not single spies But in battalions. First, her father slain: Next, your son gone; and he most violent author Of his own just remove: the people muddied, Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers, For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly, In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia Divided from herself and her fair judgment, Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts: Last, and as much containing as all these, Her brother is in secret come from France; Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds, And wants not buzzers to infect his ear With pestilent speeches of his father's death; Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd, Will nothing stick our person to arraign In ear and ear. my dear Gertrude, this, Like to a murdering-piece, in many places Gives me superfluous death. noise within Alack, what noise is this? Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door. Enter another Gentleman What is the matter? Gentleman Save yourself, my lord: The ocean, overpeering of his list, Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste Than young Laertes, in a riotous head, O'erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord; And, as the world were now but to begin, Antiquity forgot, custom not known, The ratifiers and props of every word, They cry 'Choose we: Laertes shall be king:' Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds: 'Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!' How cheerfully on the false trail they cry! this is counter, you false Danish dogs! The doors are broke. Noise within Enter armed; Danes following Where is this king? Sirs, stand you all without. Danes No, let's come in. pray you, give me leave. Danes We will, we will. They retire without the door thank you: keep the door. thou vile king, Give me my father! Calmly, good Laertes. That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard, Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot Even here, between the chaste unsmirched brow Of my true mother. What is the cause, Laertes, That thy rebellion looks so giant-like? Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person: There's such divinity doth hedge a king, That treason can but peep to what it would, Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes, Why thou art thus incensed. Let him go, Gertrude. Speak, man. Where is my father? Dead. But not by him. Let him demand his fill. How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with: To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil! Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit! dare damnation. To this point stand, That both the worlds give to negligence, Let come what comes; only I'll be revenged Most thoroughly for my father. Who shall stay you? My will, not all the world: And for my means, I'll husband them so well, They shall go far with little. Good Laertes, If you desire to know the certainty Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge, That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe, Winner and loser? None but his enemies. Will you know them then? To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms; And like the kind life-rendering pelican, Repast them with my blood. Why, now you speak Like a good child and a true gentleman. That am guiltless of your father's death, And am most sensible in grief for it, It shall as level to your judgment pierce As day does to your eye. Danes [Within] Let her come in. How now! what noise is that? Re-enter heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times salt, Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye! By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight, Till our scale turn the beam. rose of May! Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia! heavens! is't possible, a young maid's wits Should be as moral as an old man's life? Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine, It sends some precious instance of itself After the thing it loves. [Sings] They bore him barefaced on the bier; Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny; And in his grave rain'd many a tear:-- Fare you well, my dove! Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge, It could not move thus. [Sings] You must sing a-down a-down, An you call him a-down-a. how the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward, that stole his master's daughter. This nothing's more than matter. There's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray, love, remember: and there is pansies. that's for thoughts. document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted. There's fennel for you, and columbines: there's rue for you; and here's some for me: we may call it herb-grace o' Sundays: you must wear your rue with a difference. There's a daisy: would give you some violets, but they withered all when my father died: they say he made a good end,-- Sings For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy. Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself, She turns to favour and to prettiness. [Sings] And will he not come again? And will he not come again? No, no, he is dead: Go to thy death-bed: He never will come again. His beard was as white as snow, All flaxen was his poll: He is gone, he is gone, And we cast away moan: God ha' mercy on his soul! And of all Christian souls, pray God. God be wi' ye. Exit Do you see this, God? Laertes, must commune with your grief, Or you deny me right. Go but apart, Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will. And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me: If by direct or by collateral hand They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give, Our crown, our life, and all that we can ours, To you in satisfaction; but if not, Be you content to lend your patience to us, And we shall jointly labour with your soul To give it due content. Let this be so; His means of death, his obscure funeral-- No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones, No noble rite nor formal ostentation-- Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth, That must call't in question. So you shall; And where the offence is let the great axe fall. pray you, go with me. Exeunt Another room in the castle. Enter and a Servant What are they that would speak with me? Servant Sailors, sir: they say they have letters for you. Let them come in. Exit Servant do not know from what part of the world should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet. Enter Sailors First Sailor God bless you, sir. Let him bless thee too. First Sailor He shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for you, sir; it comes from the ambassador that was bound for England; if your name be Horatio, as am let to know it is. [Reads] 'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked this, give these fellows some means to the king: they have letters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on a compelled valour, and in the grapple boarded them: on the instant they got clear of our ship; so alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like thieves of mercy: but they knew what they did; am to do a good turn for them. Let the king have the letters have sent; and repair thou to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. have words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring thee where am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course for England: of them have much to tell thee. Farewell. 'He that thou knowest thine, Come, will make you way for these your letters; And do't the speedier, that you may direct me To him from whom you brought them. Exeunt Another room in the castle. Enter and Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal, And you must put me in your heart for friend, Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear, That he which hath your noble father slain Pursued my life. It well appears: but tell me Why you proceeded not against these feats, So crimeful and so capital in nature, As by your safety, wisdom, all things else, You mainly were stirr'd up. for two special reasons; Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd, But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother Lives almost by his looks; and for myself-- My virtue or my plague, be it either which-- She's so conjunctive to my life and soul, That, as the star moves not but in his sphere, could not but by her. The other motive, Why to a public count might not go, Is the great love the general gender bear him; Who, dipping all his faults in their affection, Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone, Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows, Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind, Would have reverted to my bow again, And not where had aim'd them. And so have a noble father lost; sister driven into desperate terms, Whose worth, if praises may go back again, Stood challenger on mount of all the age For her perfections: but my revenge will come. Break not your sleeps for that: you must not think That we are made of stuff so flat and dull That we can let our beard be shook with danger And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more: loved your father, and we love ourself; And that, hope, will teach you to imagine-- Enter a Messenger How now! what news? Messenger Letters, my lord, from Hamlet: This to your majesty; this to the queen. From Hamlet! who brought them? Messenger Sailors, my lord, they say; saw them not: They were given me by Claudio; he received them Of him that brought them. Laertes, you shall hear them. Leave us. Exit Messenger Reads 'High and mighty, You shall know am set naked on your kingdom. To-morrow shall beg leave to see your kingly eyes: when shall, first asking your pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden and more strange return. What should this mean? Are all the rest come back? Or is it some abuse, and no such thing? Know you the hand? 'Tis Hamlets character. 'Naked! And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.' Can you advise me? I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come; It warms the very sickness in my heart, That shall live and tell him to his teeth, 'Thus didest thou.' If it be so, Laertes-- As how should it be so? how otherwise?-- Will you be ruled by me? Ay, my lord; So you will not o'errule me to a peace. To thine own peace. If he be now return'd, As checking at his voyage, and that he means No more to undertake it, will work him To an exploit, now ripe in my device, Under the which he shall not choose but fall: And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe, But even his mother shall uncharge the practise And call it accident. My lord, will be ruled; The rather, if you could devise it so That might be the organ. It falls right. You have been talk'd of since your travel much, And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts Did not together pluck such envy from him As did that one, and that, in my regard, Of the unworthiest siege. What part is that, my lord? very riband in the cap of youth, Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes The light and careless livery that it wears Than settled age his sables and his weeds, Importing health and graveness. Two months since, Here was a gentleman of Normandy:-- I've seen myself, and served against, the French, And they can well on horseback: but this gallant Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat; And to such wondrous doing brought his horse, As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought, That in forgery of shapes and tricks, Come short of what he did. Norman was't? Norman. Upon my life, Lamond. The very same. know him well: he is the brooch indeed And gem of all the nation. He made confession of you, And gave you such a masterly report For art and exercise in your defence And for your rapier most especially, That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed, If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation, He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye, If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy That he could nothing do but wish and beg Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him. Now, out of this,-- What out of this, my lord? Laertes, was your father dear to you? Or are you like the painting of a sorrow, face without a heart? Why ask you this? Not that think you did not love your father; But that know love is begun by time; And that see, in passages of proof, Time qualifies the spark and fire of it. There lives within the very flame of love kind of wick or snuff that will abate it; And nothing is at a like goodness still; For goodness, growing to a plurisy, Dies in his own too much: that we would do We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes And hath abatements and delays as many As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents; And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh, That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer:-- Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake, To show yourself your father's son in deed More than in words? To cut his throat i' the church. No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize; Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes, Will you do this, keep close within your chamber. Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home: We'll put on those shall praise your excellence And set a double varnish on the fame The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together And wager on your heads: he, being remiss, Most generous and free from all contriving, Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease, Or with a little shuffling, you may choose sword unbated, and in a pass of practise Requite him for your father. will do't: And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword. bought an unction of a mountebank, So mortal that, but dip a knife in it, Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare, Collected from all simples that have virtue Under the moon, can save the thing from death That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point With this contagion, that, if gall him slightly, It may be death. Let's further think of this; Weigh what convenience both of time and means May fit us to our shape: if this should fail, And that our drift look through our bad performance, 'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project Should have a back or second, that might hold, If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see: We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: ha't. When in your motion you are hot and dry-- As make your bouts more violent to that end-- And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping, If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck, Our purpose may hold there. Enter How now, sweet queen! One woe doth tread upon another's heel, So fast they follow; your sister's drown'd, Laertes. Drown'd! where? There is a willow grows aslant a brook, That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream; There with fantastic garlands did she come Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples That liberal shepherds give a grosser name, But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them: There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke; When down her weedy trophies and herself Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide; And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up: Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes; As one incapable of her own distress, Or like a creature native and indued Unto that element: but long it could not be Till that her garments, heavy with their drink, Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay To muddy death. Alas, then, she is drown'd? Drown'd, drown'd. Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia, And therefore forbid my tears: but yet It is our trick; nature her custom holds, Let shame say what it will: when these are gone, The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord: have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze, But that this folly douts it. Exit Let's follow, Gertrude: How much had to do to calm his rage! Now fear this will give it start again; Therefore let's follow. Exeunt churchyard. Enter two Clowns, with spades, & c First Clown Is she to be buried in Christian burial that wilfully seeks her own salvation? Second Clown tell thee she is: and therefore make her grave straight: the crowner hath sat on her, and finds it Christian burial. First Clown How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own defence? Second Clown Why, 'tis found so. First Clown It must be 'se offendendo;' it cannot be else. For here lies the point: if drown myself wittingly, it argues an act: and an act hath three branches: it is, to act, to do, to perform: argal, she drowned herself wittingly. Second Clown Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,-- First Clown Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here stands the man; good; if the man go to this water, and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he goes,--mark you that; but if the water come to him and drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, he that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life. Second Clown But is this law? First Clown Ay, marry, is't; crowner's quest law. Second Clown Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' Christian burial. First Clown Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that great folk should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves, more than their even Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient gentleman but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers: they hold up Adam's profession. Second Clown Was he a gentleman? First Clown He was the first that ever bore arms. Second Clown Why, he had none. First Clown What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture? The Scripture says 'Adam digged:' could he dig without arms? I'll put another question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the purpose, confess thyself-- Second Clown Go to. First Clown What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter? Second Clown The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand tenants. First Clown like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows does well; but how does it well? it does well to those that do in: now thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the church: argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come. Second Clown 'Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a carpenter?' First Clown Ay, tell me that, and unyoke. Second Clown Marry, now can tell. First Clown To't. Second Clown Mass, cannot tell. Enter and at a distance First Clown Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass will not mend his pace with beating; and, when you are asked this question next, say 'a grave-maker: 'the houses that he makes last till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan: fetch me a stoup of liquor. Exit Second Clown He digs and sings In youth, when did love, did love, Methought it was very sweet, To contract, the time, for, ah, my behove, methought, there was nothing meet. Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at grave-making? Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness. 'Tis e'en so: the hand of little employment hath the daintier sense. First Clown [Sings] But age, with his stealing steps, Hath claw'd me in his clutch, And hath shipped me intil the land, As if had never been such. Throws up a skull That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once: how the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were Cain's jaw-bone, that did the first murder! It might be the pate of a politician, which this ass now o'er-reaches; one that would circumvent God, might it not? It might, my lord. Or of a courtier; which could say 'Good morrow, sweet lord! How dost thou, good lord?' This might be my lord such-a-one, that praised my lord such-a-one's horse, when he meant to beg it; might it not? Ay, my lord. Why, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, and knocked about the mazzard with a sexton's spade: here's fine revolution, an we had the trick to see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding, but to play at loggats with 'em? mine ache to think on't. First Clown [Sings] pick-axe, and a spade, a spade, For and a shrouding sheet: a pit of clay for to be made For such a guest is meet. Throws up another skull There's another: why may not that be the skull of a lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be in's time a great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries: is this the fine of his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha? Not a jot more, my lord. Is not parchment made of sheepskins? Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too. They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. will speak to this fellow. Whose grave's this, sirrah? First Clown Mine, sir. Sings a pit of clay for to be made For such a guest is meet. think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest in't. First Clown You lie out on't, sir, and therefore it is not yours: for my part, do not lie in't, and yet it is mine. 'Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine: 'tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest. First Clown 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away gain, from me to you. What man dost thou dig it for? First Clown For no man, sir. What woman, then? First Clown For none, neither. Who is to be buried in't? First Clown One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead. How absolute the knave is! we must speak by the card, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, these three years have taken a note of it; the age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he gaffs his kibe. How long hast thou been a grave-maker? First Clown Of all the days i' the year, came to't that day that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras. How long is that since? First Clown Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it was the very day that young Hamlet was born; he that is mad, and sent into England. Ay, marry, why was he sent into England? First Clown Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits there; or, if he do not, it's no great matter there. Why? First Clown 'Twill, a not be seen in him there; there the men are as mad as he. How came he mad? First Clown Very strangely, they say. How strangely? First Clown Faith, e'en with losing his wits. Upon what ground? First Clown Why, here in Denmark: have been sexton here, man and boy, thirty years. How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot? First Clown faith, if he be not rotten before he die--as we have many pocky corses now-a-days, that will scarce hold the laying in--he will last you some eight year or nine year: a tanner will last you nine year. Why he more than another? First Clown Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that he will keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body. Here's a skull now; this skull has lain in the earth three and twenty years. Whose was it? First Clown whoreson mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was? Nay, know not. First Clown pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a' poured a flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's skull, the king's jester. This? First Clown E'en that. Let me see. Takes the skull Alas, poor Yorick! knew him, Horatio: a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hath borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rims at it. Here hung those lips that have kissed know not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment, that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen? Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must come; make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tell me one thing. What's that, my lord? Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i' the earth? E'en so. And smelt so? pah! Puts down the skull E'en so, my lord. To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander, till he find it stopping a bung-hole? 'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it: as thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam, whereto he was converted, might they not stop a beer-barrel? Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay, Might stop a hole to keep the wind away: that that earth, which kept the world in awe, Should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw! But soft! but soft! aside: here comes the king. Enter Priest, & c. in procession; the Corpse of and Mourners following; their trains, & c The queen, the courtiers: who is this they follow? And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken The corse they follow did with desperate hand Fordo its own life: 'twas of some estate. Couch we awhile, and mark. Retiring with What ceremony else? That is Laertes, very noble youth: mark. What ceremony else? First Priest Her obsequies have been as far enlarged As we have warrantise: her death was doubtful; And, but that great command o'ersways the order, She should in ground unsanctified have lodged Till the last trumpet: for charitable prayers, Shards, flints and pebbles should be thrown on her; Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants, Her maiden strewments and the bringing home Of bell and burial. Must there no more be done? First Priest No more be done: We should profane the service of the dead To sing a requiem and such rest to her As to peace-parted souls. Lay her i' the earth: And from her fair and unpolluted flesh May violets spring! tell thee, churlish priest, ministering angel shall my sister be, When thou liest howling. What, the fair Ophelia! Sweets to the sweet: farewell! Scattering flowers hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife; thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid, And not have strew'd thy grave. treble woe Fall ten times treble on that cursed head, Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense Deprived thee of! Hold off the earth awhile, Till have caught her once more in mine arms: Leaps into the grave Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead, Till of this flat a mountain you have made, To o'ertop old Pelion, or the skyish head Of blue Olympus. [Advancing] What is he whose grief Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow Conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is Hamlet the Dane. Leaps into the grave The devil take thy soul! Grappling with him Thou pray'st not well. prithee, take thy fingers from my throat; For, though am not splenitive and rash, Yet have something in me dangerous, Which let thy wiseness fear: hold off thy hand. Pluck them asunder. Hamlet, Hamlet! All Gentlemen,-- Good my lord, be quiet. The Attendants part them, and they come out of the grave Why will fight with him upon this theme Until my eyelids will no longer wag. my son, what theme? loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers Could not, with all their quantity of love, Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her? he is mad, Laertes. For love of God, forbear him. 'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do: Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself? Woo't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile? I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine? To outface me with leaping in her grave? Be buried quick with her, and so will And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw Millions of acres on us, till our ground, Singeing his pate against the burning zone, Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth, I'll rant as well as thou. This is mere madness: And thus awhile the fit will work on him; Anon, as patient as the female dove, When that her golden couplets are disclosed, His silence will sit drooping. Hear you, sir; What is the reason that you use me thus? loved you ever: but it is no matter; Let Hercules himself do what he may, The cat will mew and dog will have his day. Exit pray you, good Horatio, wait upon him. Exit To Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech; We'll put the matter to the present push. Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son. This grave shall have a living monument: An hour of quiet shortly shall we see; Till then, in patience our proceeding be. Exeunt hall in the castle. Enter and So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other; You do remember all the circumstance? Remember it, my lord? Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting, That would not let me sleep: methought lay Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly, And praised be rashness for it, let us know, Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well, When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us There's a divinity that shapes our ends, Rough-hew them how we will,-- That is most certain. Up from my cabin, My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark Groped to find out them; had my desire. Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew To mine own room again; making so bold, My fears forgetting manners, to unseal Their grand commission; where found, Horatio,-- royal knavery!--an exact command, Larded with many several sorts of reasons Importing Denmark's health and England's too, With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life, That, on the supervise, no leisure bated, No, not to stay the grinding of the axe, My head should be struck off. Is't possible? Here's the commission: read it at more leisure. But wilt thou hear me how did proceed? beseech you. Being thus be-netted round with villanies,-- Ere could make a prologue to my brains, They had begun the play--I sat me down, Devised a new commission, wrote it fair: once did hold it, as our statists do, baseness to write fair and labour'd much How to forget that learning, but, sir, now It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know The effect of what wrote? Ay, good my lord. An earnest conjuration from the king, As England was his faithful tributary, As love between them like the palm might flourish, As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear And stand a comma 'tween their amities, And many such-like 'As'es of great charge, That, on the view and knowing of these contents, Without debatement further, more or less, He should the bearers put to sudden death, Not shriving-time allow'd. How was this seal'd? Why, even in that was heaven ordinant. had my father's signet in my purse, Which was the model of that Danish seal; Folded the writ up in form of the other, Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely, The changeling never known. Now, the next day Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent Thou know'st already. So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't. Why, man, they did make love to this employment; They are not near my conscience; their defeat Does by their own insinuation grow: 'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes Between the pass and fell incensed points Of mighty opposites. Why, what a king is this! Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon-- He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother, Popp'd in between the election and my hopes, Thrown out his angle for my proper life, And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience, To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd, To let this canker of our nature come In further evil? It must be shortly known to him from England What is the issue of the business there. It will be short: the interim is mine; And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.' But am very sorry, good Horatio, That to Laertes forgot myself; For, by the image of my cause, see The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours. But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me Into a towering passion. Peace! who comes here? Enter Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark. humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly? No, my good lord. Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as say, spacious in the possession of dirt. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, should impart a thing to you from his majesty. will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head. thank your lordship, it is very hot. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly. It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed. But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as 'twere,--I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head: sir, this is the matter,-- beseech you, remember-- moves him to put on his hat Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and great showing: indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see. Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, know, to divide him inventorially would dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the verity of extolment, take him to be a soul of great article; and his infusion of such dearth and rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him. The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath? Sir? Is't not possible to understand in another tongue? You will do't, sir, really. What imports the nomination of this gentleman? Of Laertes? His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent. Of him, sir. know you are not ignorant-- would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not much approve me. Well, sir? You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is-- dare not confess that, lest should compare with him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to know himself. mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed. What's his weapon? Rapier and dagger. That's two of his weapons: but, well. The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary horses: against the which he has imponed, as take it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of very liberal conceit. What call you the carriages? knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done. The carriages, sir, are the hangers. The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we could carry cannon by our sides: would it might be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses against six French swords, their assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it? The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it would come to immediate trial, if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer. How if answer 'no'? mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial. Sir, will walk here in the hall: if it please his majesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the king hold his purpose, will win for him an can; if not, will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits. Shall re-deliver you e'en so? To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will. commend my duty to your lordship. Yours, yours. Exit He does well to commend it himself; there are no tongues else for's turn. This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head. He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it. Thus has he--and many more of the same bevy that know the dressy age dotes on--only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out. Enter a Lord Lord My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time. am constant to my purpose; they follow the king's pleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever, provided be so able as now. Lord The king and queen and all are coming down. In happy time. Lord The queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play. She well instructs me. Exit Lord You will lose this wager, my lord. do not think so: since he went into France, have been in continual practise: shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here about my heart: but it is no matter. Nay, good my lord,-- It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman. If your mind dislike any thing, obey it: will forestall their repair hither, and say you are not fit. Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he leaves, what is't to leave betimes? Enter Lords, and Attendants with foils, & c Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me. puts hand into HAMLET's Give me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong; But pardon't, as you are a gentleman. This presence knows, And you must needs have heard, how am punish'd With sore distraction. What have done, That might your nature, honour and exception Roughly awake, here proclaim was madness. Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet: If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away, And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes, Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it. Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so, Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd; His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy. Sir, in this audience, Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil Free me so far in your most generous thoughts, That have shot mine arrow o'er the house, And hurt my brother. am satisfied in nature, Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most To my revenge: but in my terms of honour stand aloof; and will no reconcilement, Till by some elder masters, of known honour, have a voice and precedent of peace, To keep my name ungored. But till that time, do receive your offer'd love like love, And will not wrong it. embrace it freely; And will this brother's wager frankly play. Give us the foils. Come on. Come, one for me. I'll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance Your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night, Stick fiery off indeed. You mock me, sir. No, by this hand. Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet, You know the wager? Very well, my lord Your grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side. do not fear it; have seen you both: But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds. This is too heavy, let me see another. This likes me well. These foils have all a length? They prepare to play Ay, my good lord. Set me the stoops of wine upon that table. If Hamlet give the first or second hit, Or quit in answer of the third exchange, Let all the battlements their ordnance fire: The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath; And in the cup an union shall he throw, Richer than that which four successive kings In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups; And let the kettle to the trumpet speak, The trumpet to the cannoneer without, The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth, 'Now the king dunks to Hamlet.' Come, begin: And you, the judges, bear a wary eye. Come on, sir. Come, my lord. They play One. No. Judgment. hit, a very palpable hit. Well; again. Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine; Here's to thy health. Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within Give him the cup. I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come. They play Another hit; what say you? touch, a touch, do confess. Our son shall win. He's fat, and scant of breath. Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows; The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet. Good madam! Gertrude, do not drink. will, my lord; pray you, pardon me. [Aside] It is the poison'd cup: it is too late. dare not drink yet, madam; by and by. Come, let me wipe thy face. My lord, I'll hit him now. do not think't. [Aside] And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience. Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally; pray you, pass with your best violence; am afeard you make a wanton of me. Say you so? come on. They play Nothing, neither way. Have at you now! wounds then in scuffling, they change rapiers, and wounds Part them; they are incensed. Nay, come, again. falls Look to the queen there, ho! They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord? How is't, Laertes? Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric; am justly kill'd with mine own treachery. How does the queen? She swounds to see them bleed. No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,-- The drink, the drink! am poison'd. Dies villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd: Treachery! Seek it out. It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain; No medicine in the world can do thee good; In thee there is not half an hour of life; The treacherous instrument is in thy hand, Unbated and envenom'd: the foul practise Hath turn'd itself on me lo, here lie, Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd: can no more: the king, the king's to blame. The point!--envenom'd too! Then, venom, to thy work. Stabs All Treason! treason! yet defend me, friends; am but hurt. Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane, Drink off this potion. Is thy union here? Follow my mother. dies He is justly served; It is a poison temper'd by himself. Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet: Mine and my father's death come not upon thee, Nor thine on me. Dies Heaven make thee free of it! follow thee. am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu! You that look pale and tremble at this chance, That are but mutes or audience to this act, Had but time--as this fell sergeant, death, Is strict in his arrest--O, could tell you-- But let it be. Horatio, am dead; Thou livest; report me and my cause aright To the unsatisfied. Never believe it: am more an antique Roman than a Dane: Here's yet some liquor left. As thou'rt a man, Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have't. good Horatio, what a wounded name, Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me! If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart Absent thee from felicity awhile, And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain, To tell my story. March afar off, and shot within What warlike noise is this? Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland, To the ambassadors of England gives This warlike volley. die, Horatio; The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit: cannot live to hear the news from England; But do prophesy the election lights On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice; So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less, Which have solicited. The rest is silence. Dies Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince: And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest! Why does the drum come hither? March within Enter the English Ambassadors, and others Where is this sight? What is it ye would see? If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search. This quarry cries on havoc. proud death, What feast is toward in thine eternal cell, That thou so many princes at a shot So bloodily hast struck? First Ambassador The sight is dismal; And our affairs from England come too late: The ears are senseless that should give us hearing, To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd, That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead: Where should we have our thanks? Not from his mouth, Had it the ability of life to thank you: He never gave commandment for their death. But since, so jump upon this bloody question, You from the Polack wars, and you from England, Are here arrived give order that these bodies High on a stage be placed to the view; And let me speak to the yet unknowing world How these things came about: so shall you hear Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts, Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters, Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause, And, in this upshot, purposes mistook Fall'n on the inventors' reads: all this can Truly deliver. Let us haste to hear it, And call the noblest to the audience. For me, with sorrow embrace my fortune: have some rights of memory in this kingdom, Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me. Of that shall have also cause to speak, And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more; But let this same be presently perform'd, Even while men's minds are wild; lest more mischance On plots and errors, happen. Let four captains Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage; For he was likely, had he been put on, To have proved most royally: and, for his passage, The soldiers' music and the rites of war Speak loudly for him. Take up the bodies: such a sight as this Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss. Go, bid the soldiers shoot. dead march. Exeunt, bearing off the dead bodies; after which a peal of ordnance is shot off
